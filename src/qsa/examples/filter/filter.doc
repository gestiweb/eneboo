\title Filters example, Using QSA as software component glue

It is a common approach in software development to separate
functionallity into different software components. In this article we
try to describe how a scripting language combined with good C++
bindings can increase the flexibitly and reuse value of individual
software components.

The application used in this article contains a set of processing
components used for image filtering. For simplicity we will refer to
these components as modules. In this example we provide a module for
loading an image from disk and another for displaying the image on
screen. In addition we provide some modules to do the processing in
between.

What we wish to show with this application is how QSA can be used to
script enable software components in such a way that it increases the
overall flexibility with a minimum amount of programming effort. This
gain comes from using already existing code and simply glue it
together using QSA.

\section 1 The Modules

First we will now go through how the modules in the application work
and how they can be used from QSA. For the sake of reference, lets
start with a simple example:

\code
var loader = new ImageSource;
connect( loader, "output(Data)", Renderer, "input(Data)" );
loader.file = "myimage.png";
loader.load(); 
\endcode

What happens in this script is that we create one module, the
ImageSource, used to load an image from disk. In addition we use the
global module Renderer, used to display an image on the screen. We set
up the chain of processing by connecting the output of the ImageSource
to the input of the Renderer. We then set the filename for the
ImageSource start processing by calling the function load() in the
ImageSource. The ImageSource will then load the image and give the
image to the Renderer which displays will it.

The ImageSource class in example above is really a C++ class that has
been made available from script using functionallity in QSA. For this
to work, the C++ class has be derived from QObject. When this
requirement is met all the class' slots and properties are
automatically accessible from the scripting language. Also, to be able
to instantiate the class from script we also need to implement a
subclass of \link qsobjectfactory.html QSObjectFactory \endlink that
will, on demand from QSA, create an instnace of the module. The
implementation of the module factory can be found in the sourcefiles:
modulefactory.h and modulefactory.cpp.

When a module receives input via its input slot, it will process that
input and send the result to all modules connected to its output
signal. It is important to realise that only the setting up of
processing chains and configuration of modules are done in the
script. The real number crunching is done in C++ which means that the
execution speed is limited only by the efficiency of the C++
implementation, while still obtaining the flexibility that a scripting
language offers.

An image has been represented using a simple class called Data, as can
be seen from the connect statement above. Objects of this class are
not used from within the script so we do not provide any bindings for
it. It is only visible in the connect statements and within the C++ 
modules.

A list of the modules implemented in the example and a short
description of them follows below. The implementation of the modules
can be viewed in modules.h and modules.cpp.

\list
\i <b>BumpMapper</b> <br>
This module is used to create a bumpmap from the input
data. Bumpmapping is a simple light rendering technique where one
specifies a surface map and a light source. The output is then
generated by calculating the intensity of light for each pixel. 
  \list 
    \i slot input( Data ); The surface to do bumpmapping on. White in
	the image represents high and black represents low.
    \i signal output( Data ); The result, connect to this signal to send
	the result to other modules.
    \i light : Point; The position of the light.
    \i smoothness : Number; A factor describing the smoothness of the
	image, small numbers mean a steep surface, and large numbers
	mean a smooth surface.
    \i radius : Number; The radius describes the radius of the
	light source in number of pixels.
  \endlist

\i <b>ImageSource</b> <br>
This module is used to load an image from disk and put it into
the databuffer that is for processing in this example.
  \list
    \i signal output( Data ); The image that is loaded
    \i file : String; 
	The filename of the image that should be loaded. The 
	image is converted to grayscale automatically so 
	any image type supported by Qt can be specified.
  \endlist

\i <b>Renderer</b> <br>
This module is used to display an image on screen. This is done
by converting the databuffer to grayscale image and paint it
on a widget. The Renderer module is a global object reachable
using \c Application.Renderer or \c Renderer, and can not 
be instantiated using \c new as the other modules. This done
to ensure that renderering always happens to the same window 
and that the renderer is not memory managed and deleted by 
the engine as other user defined script objects are.
  \list 
    \i slot input( Data ); The image to display
  \endlist

\i <b>Threshold</b> <br>
This module is used to strengthen the contrasts in the image by
reducing the number of shades used so that the contrast between them
becomes more visible.
  \list
    \i slot input( Data ); The image to process on.
    \i signal output( Data ); The processed image.
    \i steps : Number; 
	The steps factor describes the number of shades that should
	be used in the output image.
  \endlist

\i <b>Smudger</b> <br> 
This module is a simple blurring algorithm. It calculates the average
value for each pixel based on the surrounding pixels.
  \list
    \i slot input( Data ); The image to blur.
    \i signal output( Data ); The blurred image.
    \i steps : Number; 
	This value specifies the number iterations that are taken.
	For each iteration the avarege of every pixel is calculated
	once.
  \endlist
\endlist

\section 1 The Application

The application that has been written in this example is very simple
if we assume that the modules exists (this is after all the idea, to
script enable existing code to gain more flexibility). For user
interface we use the QSA Workbench which gives us the possibility to
edit and run scripts. In addition we implemented the module factory
which exposes the modules. 

Below is one of the sample scripts available in the example file \c
main.qs. It uses all the available modules.  Below is shown the two
images of how the filtering works. Unprocessed (left) and processed
(right).  The example sets up the processing to first load the
image. The image is then sent into the Threshold module which creates
the steps in the resulting image. The thresholded image is then sent
to the Smudger module where the edges are smoothed out a bit, causing
a more gliding transition between the steps in the image.  The next
step is the BumpMapper module where the light source is positioned in
the upper left region of the image causing this area to be illuminated
while shadows are cast on the other side. Finally the image reaches
the renderer which opens up a window displaying the resulting image.

\table
\row \i \img filter_1.png 
     \i \img filter_2.png 
\endtable

\code
function doAll() 
{
    var src = new ImageSource();
    var bump = new BumpMapper();
    var thres = new Threshold();
    var blur = new Smudger();

    connect( src,   'output(Data)', thres.input );
    connect( thres, 'output(Data)', blur.input );
    connect( blur,  'output(Data)', bump.input );
    connect( bump,  'output(Data)', Renderer.input );

    src.file = 'bump.jpg';
    thres.steps = 10;
    bump.smoothness = 4;
    bump.light = new Point( 150, 150 );
    bump.radius = 250;
    blur.iterations = 4;
    src.load();    
}\endcode

As a simple exercise, try to change some of the module properties or
reconnect them in a different order to see what happens when you run
the function again.

\section 1 Why not use a specialized GUI for this?

At this point one might be thinking that this is no different than the
same code written in C++ using the components directly. This is true
if one want to recompile for every small change one does, that is, if
you have access to source code and a compiler at all.

It would also be possible to provide the same level of functionallity
in a graphical application. One could write a configuration dialog for
each module and write a widget for doing the connections
graphically. Such a GUI takes time to write, and will most likely be
task specific. Scripting the same functionallity can be done directly
with only a minimal amount of programming, if any at all. There are
also some features that are more difficult to reflect in a GUI, such
as iterations and conditional execution. These are easily available in
a scripting language, but are not trivial to represent in a graphical
application.

Another common usage area of application scripting is the on-the-fly
customization of existing functionallity, in which case one does not
wish to spend time programming user interfaces, but rather hook
together the pieces you want with a few scripting statements and let
it run. For this purpose scripting is ideal.

\section 1 Famous last words

We have now shown how wrapping C++ functionallity in QSA increases the
flexibility and usability of existing code. We make use of the
QSObjectFactory to enable use of C++ classes from script and we use
the QSA Workbench to easily get the possility to edit and run
scripts. All in all it shows how QSA can improve the functionallity
of existsing application code.
