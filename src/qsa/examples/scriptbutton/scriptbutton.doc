  \title Scriptbutton

The Scriptbutton example demonstrates how to implement a GUI control with a
customizable action on activation. ScriptButton is a specialized
\c QPushButton class that can have a snippet of script code attached to
it. The script will be executed whenever the user clicks on the
button. To modify the behavior of the buttons, the user can right-click
a button and choose to either rename the button label or edit the
script code in a simple editor. 

The Scriptbutton example also shows how to extend the scripting API of
an existing C++ \c QObject class, which in this case is \c QWidget.
Here we extend every QWidget class by two scripting functions: \c
sendMousePressEvent() and \c sendMouseReleaseEvent(). These functions
will show up in the API of every \c QWidget subclass and will then allow
the scriptwriter to send mouse press and release events to any
\c QWidget.   

For demonstration purposes, the example widget contains both a
\c QLCDNumber and \c QLineEdit widget with properties that can be changed by
the buttons located on the right side of the dialog.
 
\section1 Implementing Scriptbutton

The scriptbutton is a \c QPushButton subclass and contains an extra
property which stores the code that will be executed when clicking the
button. To edit the code, a subclass of \c QSEditor is used. The
scriptbutton's code is passed into a call to \c QSInterpreter::evaluate()
in the scriptbutton's \c executeScript() slot, which is connected to
its \c clicked() signal.

\section1 Implementation of the QWidget Extension

To extend the \c QWidget API for the script writer, we implement a class
\c WidgetWrapper which inherits \c QObject and takes the widget it wraps in
its constructor. \c WidgetWrapper then implements the two slots
\c sendMousePressEvent() and \c sendMouseReleaseEvent() which send a mouse
event to the wrapped widget.

To make this wrapper known to the Qt Script Interpreter, we implement
a \c WidgetWrapperFactory which inherits \c QSWrapperFactory. This
enables the Qt Script Interpreter to create a WidgetWrapper for every
\c QWidget it exposes to Qt Script.
