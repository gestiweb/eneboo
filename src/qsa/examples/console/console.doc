\title Console

The console example demonstrates how QSA can be used as an interactive scripting
console where each command you type is automatically run in the interpreter.

The console example consists of three different widgets. The Input
widget is used for writing script code and it is the largest and most
important one of these is the input widget. This widget lies in the
center of the dialog. The output window widget is found in the
uppermost text area it displays output from print commands. It also
displays syntax and logic errors. The third widget is the history
window, situated in the lowermost text area of the dialog.History
displays all of the commands that the user has typed.

The following sections will show an example and description of the console application.

\section1 A Line by Line Example

We will start by stepping thought line by line of a simple example
where we create a dialog that reads and displays the first and last
name that is typed into a line edit. Altough some lines are grouped
together, you should try to type them in one by one and press enter
between each line. The example below relies strongly on the 
\link qsa-6.book Input Dialog Framework \endlink.

\code var dialog = new Dialog; \endcode

We start by creating a dialog.

\code dialog.exec(); \endcode

To verify that the dialog actually changes, we will display the dialog before
any changes have been made to it. The dialog pops up with only an \c Ok
and \c Cancel button on it. The function \c exec() is in the \c Dialog class.
Close the dialog and continue with the steps below.

\code
dialog.title = "Name reading dialog";
dialog.okButtonText = "Done"
dialog.cancelButtonText = "Abort";
dialog.exec();
\endcode

The preceding code configures the dialog to fit our needs. We set the
title and modify the text on the \c OK and \c Cancel buttons. When you
type \c dialog.exec() at the end of the code, the dialog pops up with your
changes. When you have confirmed that the changes have taken
place, close the dialog.

\code
var first = new LineEdit;
first.label = "First name: ";
dialog.add( first );
dialog.exec(); 
\endcode

This code creates a line edit which we will use to read the
first name.  We change the label to "First name: " and add it to the
dialog. When we call \c exec(), the dialog will now contain your new
line edit. Close the dialog again.

\code
var last = new LineEdit;
last.label = "Last name: ";
dialog.add( last );
dialog.exec();
\endcode

We need to add another line edit for typing the last name. Change
the label to "Last name: ", and add the line edit to the dialog.
Type in \c dialog.exec() to run the dialog. Type in your first and
last name in the respective input fields and press \Button Done.

Finally, we need to add the following code to get the result from the
dialog and print it out.

\code
var fullName = last.text + ", " + first.text;
print( "Full name is: " + fullName );
\endcode

\section1 Console in Detail

The console example uses an instance of \link qsinterpreter.html
QSInterpreter \endlink and the function \link
qsinterpreter.html#evaluate() QSInterpreter::evaluate() \endlink to
give line by line commands that are interpreted. To have some classes
to play with, we make the \link qsinputdialogfactory.html Input Dialog
Framework \endlink available to the scripting engine using the
function \link qsinterpreter.html#addObjectFactory
QSInterpreter::addObjectFactory \endlink.

The input widget is a \link qseditor.html QSEditor \endlink, which
means that all script code is written with syntax highlighting and
completion. To get completion on all the classes that an interpreter
knows about, we have to tell the editor which interpreter we are
using. (In the most common case of using QSEditor, it is handled using
\link qsproject.html QSProject \endlink, but in this example we have
no project and therefore have to make the binding ourselves). This is
done by calling the function \link qseditor.html#setInterpreter
QSEditor::setInterpreter() \endlink. Without making this binding, the
syntax completion would, for example, not be able to tell that the
input dialog framework was available in the interpreter.

We have installed an event filter on the QSEditor so that we can
provide the line by line interpretation of the script code that we
want. If the user presses enter, we perform a syntax check on the
source code in the editor using \link qsinterpreter.html#checkSyntax
QSInterpreter::checkSyntax() \endlink. If it passes, the code is
evaluated. The return value from the interpreter (typically the value
of the last statement executed) is always displayed in the output
window. If you want to write multi-line commands, use \Key Control+Enter
to go to the next line without evaluating the code.

\section1 Conclusion

The console example shows how QSA can be used as an input form for
giving interactive commands. It also sho how QSEditor can be embedded
in an arbitrary user interface without the use of QSA Workbench or the project.
