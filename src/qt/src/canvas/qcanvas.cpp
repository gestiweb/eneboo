    \brief The QCanvas class provides a 2D area that can contain QCanvasItem objects.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">Qt Enterprise Edition</a>.
\endif

    \mainclass
    \module canvas

    The QCanvas class manages its 2D graphic area and all the canvas
    items the area contains. The canvas has no visual appearance of
    its own. Instead, it is displayed on screen using a QCanvasView.
    Multiple QCanvasView widgets may be associated with a canvas to
    provide multiple views of the same canvas.

    The canvas is optimized for large numbers of items, particularly
    where only a small percentage of the items change at any
    one time. If the entire display changes very frequently, you should
    consider using your own custom QScrollView subclass.

    Qt provides a rich
    set of canvas item classes, e.g. QCanvasEllipse, QCanvasLine,
    QCanvasPolygon, QCanvasPolygonalItem, QCanvasRectangle, QCanvasSpline,
    QCanvasSprite and QCanvasText. You can subclass to create your own
    canvas items; QCanvasPolygonalItem is the most common base class used
    for this purpose.

    Items appear on the canvas after their \link QCanvasItem::show()
    show()\endlink function has been called (or \link
    QCanvasItem::setVisible() setVisible(TRUE)\endlink), and \e after
    update() has been called. The canvas only shows items that are
    \link QCanvasItem::setVisible() visible\endlink, and then only if
    \l update() is called. (By default the canvas is white and so are
    canvas items, so if nothing appears try changing colors.)

    If you created the canvas without passing a width and height to
    the constructor you must also call resize().

    Although a canvas may appear to be similar to a widget with child
    widgets, there are several notable differences:

    \list
    \i Canvas items are usually much faster to manipulate and redraw than
    child widgets, with the speed advantage becoming especially great when
    there are \e many canvas items and non-rectangular items. In most
    situations canvas items are also a lot more memory efficient than child
    widgets.

    \i It's easy to detect overlapping items (collision detection).

    \i The canvas can be larger than a widget. A million-by-million canvas
    is perfectly possible. At such a size a widget might be very
    inefficient, and some window systems might not support it at all,
    whereas QCanvas scales well. Even with a billion pixels and a million
    items, finding a particular canvas item, detecting collisions, etc.,
    is still fast (though the memory consumption may be prohibitive
    at such extremes).

    \i Two or more QCanvasView objects can view the same canvas.

    \i An arbitrary transformation matrix can be set on each QCanvasView
    which makes it easy to zoom, rotate or shear the viewed canvas.

    \i Widgets provide a lot more functionality, such as input (QKeyEvent,
    QMouseEvent etc.) and layout management (QGridLayout etc.).

    \endlist

    A canvas consists of a background, a number of canvas items organized by
    x, y and z coordinates, and a foreground. A canvas item's z coordinate
    can be treated as a layer number -- canvas items with a higher z
    coordinate appear in front of canvas items with a lower z coordinate.

    The background is white by default, but can be set to a different color
    using setBackgroundColor(), or to a repeated pixmap using
    setBackgroundPixmap() or to a mosaic of smaller pixmaps using
    setTiles(). Individual tiles can be set with setTile(). There
    are corresponding get functions, e.g. backgroundColor() and
    backgroundPixmap().

    Note that QCanvas does not inherit from QWidget, even though it has some
    functions which provide the same functionality as those in QWidget. One
    of these is setBackgroundPixmap(); some others are resize(), size(),
    width() and height(). \l QCanvasView is the widget used to display a
    canvas on the screen.

    Canvas items are added to a canvas by constructing them and passing the
    canvas to the canvas item's constructor. An item can be moved to a
    different canvas using QCanvasItem::setCanvas().

    Canvas items are movable (and in the case of QCanvasSprites, animated)
    objects that inherit QCanvasItem. Each canvas item has a position on the
    canvas (x, y coordinates) and a height (z coordinate), all of which are
    held as floating-point numbers. Moving canvas items also have x and y
    velocities. It's possible for a canvas item to be outside the canvas
    (for example QCanvasItem::x() is greater than width()). When a canvas
    item is off the canvas, onCanvas() returns FALSE and the canvas
    disregards the item. (Canvas items off the canvas do not slow down any
    of the common operations on the canvas.)

    Canvas items can be moved with QCanvasItem::move(). The advance()
    function moves all QCanvasItem::animated() canvas items and
    setAdvancePeriod() makes QCanvas move them automatically on a periodic
    basis. In the context of the QCanvas classes, to `animate' a canvas item
    is to set it in motion, i.e. using QCanvasItem::setVelocity(). Animation
    of a canvas item itself, i.e. items which change over time, is enabled
    by calling QCanvasSprite::setFrameAnimation(), or more generally by
    subclassing and reimplementing QCanvasItem::advance(). To detect collisions
    use one of the QCanvasItem::collisions() functions.

    The changed parts of the canvas are redrawn (if they are visible in a
    canvas view) whenever update() is called. You can either call update()
    manually after having changed the contents of the canvas, or force
    periodic updates using setUpdatePeriod(). If you have moving objects on
    the canvas, you must call advance() every time the objects should
    move one step further. Periodic calls to advance() can be forced using
    setAdvancePeriod(). The advance() function will call
    QCanvasItem::advance() on every item that is \link
    QCanvasItem::animated() animated\endlink and trigger an update of the
    affected areas afterwards. (A canvas item that is `animated' is simply
    a canvas item that is in motion.)

    QCanvas organizes its canvas items into \e chunks; these are areas on
    the canvas that are used to speed up most operations. Many operations
    start by eliminating most chunks (i.e. those which haven't changed)
    and then process only the canvas items that are in the few interesting
    (i.e. changed) chunks. A valid chunk, validChunk(), is one which is on
    the canvas.

    The chunk size is a key factor to QCanvas's speed: if there are too many
    chunks, the speed benefit of grouping canvas items into chunks is
    reduced. If the chunks are too large, it takes too long to process each
    one. The QCanvas constructor tries to pick a suitable size, but you
    can call retune() to change it at any time. The chunkSize() function
    returns the current chunk size. The canvas items always make sure
    they're in the right chunks; all you need to make sure of is that
    the canvas uses the right chunk size. A good rule of thumb is that
    the size should be a bit smaller than the average canvas item
    size. If you have moving objects, the chunk size should be a bit
    smaller than the average size of the moving items.

    The foreground is normally nothing, but if you reimplement
    drawForeground(), you can draw things in front of all the canvas
    items.

    Areas can be set as changed with setChanged() and set unchanged with
    setUnchanged(). The entire canvas can be set as changed with
    setAllChanged(). A list of all the items on the canvas is returned by
    allItems().

    An area can be copied (painted) to a QPainter with drawArea().

    If the canvas is resized it emits the resized() signal.

    The examples/canvas application and the 2D graphics page of the
    examples/demo application demonstrate many of QCanvas's facilities.

    canvas items which are in the same chunk as the changed canvas
    items.

    Internally, a canvas uses a low-resolution "chunk matrix" to keep
    track of all the items in the canvas. A 64x64 chunk matrix is the
    default for a 1024x1024 pixel canvas, where each chunk collects
    canvas items in a 16x16 pixel square. This default is also
    affected by setTiles(). You can tune this default using this
    function. For example if you have a very large canvas and want to
    trade off speed for memory then you might set the chunk size to 32
    or 64.

    The \a mxclusters argument is the number of rectangular groups of
    chunks that will be separately drawn. If the canvas has a large
    number of small, dispersed items, this should be about that
    number. Our testing suggests that a large number of clusters is
    almost always best.

    \class QCanvasItem qcanvas.h
    \brief The QCanvasItem class provides an abstract graphic object on a QCanvas.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">Qt Enterprise Edition</a>.
\endif

    \module canvas
    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup images

    A variety of QCanvasItem subclasses provide immediately usable
    behaviour. This class is a pure abstract superclass providing the
    behaviour that is shared among all the concrete canvas item classes.
    QCanvasItem is not intended for direct subclassing. It is much easier
    to subclass one of its subclasses, e.g. QCanvasPolygonalItem (the
    commonest base class), QCanvasRectangle, QCanvasSprite, QCanvasEllipse
    or QCanvasText.

    Canvas items are added to a canvas by constructing them and passing the
    canvas to the canvas item's constructor. An item can be moved to a
    different canvas using setCanvas().

    Items appear on the canvas after their \link show() show()\endlink
    function has been called (or \link setVisible()
    setVisible(TRUE)\endlink), and \e after update() has been called. The
    canvas only shows items that are \link setVisible() visible\endlink,
    and then only if \l update() is called. If you created the canvas
    without passing a width and height to the constructor you'll also need
    to call \link QCanvas::resize() resize()\endlink. Since the canvas
    background defaults to white and canvas items default to white,
    you may need to change colors to see your items.

    A QCanvasItem object can be moved in the x(), y() and z() dimensions
    using functions such as move(), moveBy(), setX(), setY() and setZ(). A
    canvas item can be set in motion, `animated', using setAnimated() and
    given a velocity in the x and y directions with setXVelocity() and
    setYVelocity() -- the same effect can be achieved by calling
    setVelocity(). Use the collidesWith() function to see if the canvas item
    will collide on the \e next advance(1) and use collisions() to see what
    collisions have occurred.

    Use QCanvasSprite or your own subclass of QCanvasSprite to create canvas
    items which are animated, i.e. which change over time.

    The size of a canvas item is given by boundingRect(). Use
    boundingRectAdvanced() to see what the size of the canvas item will be
    \e after the next advance(1) call.

    The rtti() function is used for identifying subclasses of QCanvasItem.
    The canvas() function returns a pointer to the canvas which contains the
    canvas item.

    QCanvasItem provides the show() and isVisible() functions like those in
    QWidget.

    QCanvasItem also provides the setEnabled(), setActive() and
    setSelected() functions; these functions set the relevant boolean and
    cause a repaint but the boolean values they set are not used in
    QCanvasItem itself. You can make use of these booleans in your subclasses.

    By default, canvas items have no velocity, no size, and are not in
    motion. The subclasses provided in Qt do not change these defaults
    except where noted.

    A canvas sprite is an object which can contain any number of images
    (referred to as frames), only one of which is current, i.e.
    displayed, at any one time. The images can be passed in the
    constructor or set or changed later with setSequence(). If you
    subclass QCanvasSprite you can change the frame that is displayed
    periodically, e.g. whenever QCanvasItem::advance(1) is called to
    create the effect of animation.

    The current frame can be set with setFrame() or with move(). The
    number of frames available is given by frameCount(). The bounding
    rectangle of the current frame is returned by boundingRect().

    The current frame's image can be retrieved with image(); use
    imageAdvanced() to retrieve the image for the frame that will be
    shown after advance(1) is called. Use the image() overload passing
    it an integer index to retrieve a particular image from the list of
    frames.

    Use width() and height() to retrieve the dimensions of the current
    frame.

    Use leftEdge() and rightEdge() to retrieve the current frame's
    left-hand and right-hand x-coordinates respectively. Use
    bottomEdge() and topEdge() to retrieve the current frame's bottom
    and top y-coordinates respectively. These functions have an overload
    which will accept an integer frame number to retrieve the
    coordinates of a particular frame.

    QCanvasSprite draws very quickly, at the expense of memory.

    The current frame's image can be drawn on a painter with draw().

    Like any other canvas item, canvas sprites can be moved with
    move() which sets the x and y coordinates and the frame number, as
    well as with QCanvasItem::move() and QCanvasItem::moveBy(), or by
    setting coordinates with QCanvasItem::setX(), QCanvasItem::setY()
    and QCanvasItem::setZ().

/*!
    Returns the list of canvas items that this canvas item has
    collided with.

    A collision is generally defined as occurring when the pixels of
    one item draw on the pixels of another item, but not all
    subclasses are so precise. Also, since pixel-wise collision
    detection can be slow, this function works in either exact or
    inexact mode, according to the \a exact parameter.

    If \a exact is TRUE, the canvas items returned have been
    accurately tested for collision with the canvas item.

    If \a exact is FALSE, the canvas items returned are \e near the
    canvas item. You can test the canvas items returned using
    collidesWith() if any are interesting collision candidates. By
    using this approach, you can ignore some canvas items for which
    collisions are not relevant.

    The returned list is a list of QCanvasItems, but often you will
    need to cast the items to their subclass types. The safe way to do
    this is to use rtti() before casting. This provides some of the
    functionality of the standard C++ dynamic cast operation even on
    compilers where dynamic casts are not available.

    Note that a canvas item may be `on' a canvas, e.g. it was created
    with the canvas as parameter, even though its coordinates place it
    beyond the edge of the canvas's area. Collision detection only
    works for canvas items which are wholly or partly within the
    canvas's area.

    Note that if items have a velocity (see \l setVelocity()), then
    collision testing is done based on where the item \e will be when
    it moves, not its current location. For example, a "ball" item
    doesn't need to actually embed into a "wall" item before a
    collision is detected. For items without velocity, plain
    intersection is used.

    If you want to show a single pixmap on a QCanvas use a
    QCanvasSprite with just one pixmap.

    When pixmaps are inserted into a QCanvasPixmapArray they are held
    as QCanvasPixmaps. \l{QCanvasSprite}s are used to show pixmaps on
    \l{QCanvas}es and hold their pixmaps in a QCanvasPixmapArray. If
    you retrieve a frame (pixmap) from a QCanvasSprite it will be
    returned as a QCanvasPixmap.

    The pixmap is a QPixmap and can only be set in the constructor.
    There are three different constructors, one taking a QPixmap, one
    a QImage and one a file name that refers to a file in any
    supported file format (see QImageIO).

    QCanvasPixmap can have a hotspot which is defined in terms of an (x,
    y) offset. When you create a QCanvasPixmap from a PNG file or from
    a QImage that has a QImage::offset(), the offset() is initialized
    appropriately, otherwise the constructor leaves it at (0, 0). You
    can set it later using setOffset(). When the QCanvasPixmap is used
    in a QCanvasSprite, the offset position is the point at
    QCanvasItem::x() and QCanvasItem::y(), not the top-left corner of
    the pixmap.

    Note that for QCanvasPixmap objects created by a QCanvasSprite, the
    position of each QCanvasPixmap object is set so that the hotspot
    stays in the same position.

    This class is used by QCanvasSprite to hold an array of pixmaps.
    It is used to implement animated sprites, i.e. images that change
    over time, with each pixmap in the array holding one frame.

    Depending on the constructor you use you can load multiple pixmaps
    into the array either from a directory (specifying a wildcard
    pattern for the files), or from a list of QPixmaps. You can also
    read in a set of pixmaps after construction using readPixmaps().

    Individual pixmaps can be set with setImage() and retrieved with
    image(). The number of pixmaps in the array is returned by
    count().

    QCanvasSprite uses an image's mask for collision detection. You
    can change this by reading in a separate set of image masks using

    \brief The QCanvasView class provides an on-screen view of a QCanvas.

\endif

    \module canvas
    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup images

    A QCanvasView is widget which provides a view of a QCanvas.

    If you want users to be able to interact with a canvas view,
    subclass QCanvasView. You might then reimplement
    QScrollView::contentsMousePressEvent(). For example, assuming no
    transformation matrix is set:

    \code
    void MyCanvasView::contentsMousePressEvent( QMouseEvent* e )
    {
	QCanvasItemList l = canvas()->collisions(e->pos());
	for (QCanvasItemList::Iterator it=l.begin(); it!=l.end(); ++it) {
	    if ( (*it)->rtti() == QCanvasRectangle::RTTI )
		qDebug("A QCanvasRectangle lies somewhere at this point");
	}
    }
    \endcode

    The canvas view shows canvas canvas(); this can be changed using
    setCanvas().

    A transformation matrix can be used to transform the view of the
    canvas in various ways, for example, zooming in or out or rotating.
    For example:

    \code
    QWMatrix wm;
    wm.scale( 2, 2 );   // Zooms in by 2 times
    wm.rotate( 90 );    // Rotates 90 degrees counter clockwise
			// around the origin.
    wm.translate( 0, -canvas->height() );
			// moves the canvas down so what was visible
			// before is still visible.
    myCanvasView->setWorldMatrix( wm );
    \endcode

    Use setWorldMatrix() to set the canvas view's world matrix: you must
    ensure that the world matrix is invertible. The current world matrix
    is retrievable with worldMatrix(), and its inversion is retrievable
    with inverseWorldMatrix().

    Example:

    The following code finds the part of the canvas that is visible in
    this view, i.e. the bounding rectangle of the view in canvas coordinates.

    \code
    QRect rc = QRect( myCanvasView->contentsX(), myCanvasView->contentsY(),
			myCanvasView->visibleWidth(), myCanvasView->visibleHeight() );
    QRect canvasRect = myCanvasView->inverseWorldMatrix().mapRect(rc);
    \endcode

    \class QCanvasPolygonalItem qcanvas.h
    \brief The QCanvasPolygonalItem class provides a polygonal canvas item

    The mostly rectangular classes, such as QCanvasSprite and
    QCanvasText, use the object's bounding rectangle for movement,
    repainting and collision calculations. For most other items, the
    bounding rectangle can be far too large -- a diagonal line being
    the worst case, and there are many other cases which are also bad.
    QCanvasPolygonalItem provides polygon-based bounding rectangle
    handling, etc., which is much faster for non-rectangular items.

    Derived classes should try to define as small an area as possible
    to maximize efficiency, but the polygon must \e definitely be
    contained completely within the polygonal area. Calculating the
    exact requirements is usually difficult, but if you allow a small
    overestimate it can be easy and quick, while still getting almost
    all of QCanvasPolygonalItem's speed.

    Note that all subclasses \e must call hide() in their destructor
    since hide() needs to be able to access areaPoints().

    Normally, QCanvasPolygonalItem uses the odd-even algorithm for
    determining whether an object intersects this object. You can
    change this to the winding algorithm using setWinding().

    The bounding rectangle is available using boundingRect(). The
    points bounding the polygonal item are retrieved with
    areaPoints(). Use areaPointsAdvanced() to retrieve the bounding
    points the polygonal item \e will have after
    QCanvasItem::advance(1) has been called.

    If the shape of the polygonal item is about to change while the
    item is visible, call invalidate() before updating with a
    different result from \l areaPoints().

    By default, QCanvasPolygonalItem objects have a black pen and no
    brush (the default QPen and QBrush constructors). You can change
    this with setPen() and setBrush(), but note that some
    QCanvasPolygonalItem subclasses only use the brush, ignoring the
    pen setting.

    The polygonal item can be drawn on a painter with draw().
    Subclasses must reimplement drawShape() to draw themselves.

    Like any other canvas item polygonal items can be moved with
    QCanvasItem::move() and QCanvasItem::moveBy(), or by setting coordinates
    with QCanvasItem::setX(), QCanvasItem::setY() and QCanvasItem::setZ().

    A QCanvasSpline is a sequence of 4-point bezier curves joined
    together to make a curved shape.

    You set the control points of the spline with setControlPoints().

    If the bezier is closed(), then the first control point will be
    re-used as the last control point. Therefore, a closed bezier must
    have a multiple of 3 control points and an open bezier must have
    one extra point.

    The beziers are not necessarily joined "smoothly". To ensure this,
    set control points appropriately (general reference texts about
    beziers will explain this in detail).

    Like any other canvas item splines can be moved with
    QCanvasItem::move() and QCanvasItem::moveBy(), or by setting
    coordinates with QCanvasItem::setX(), QCanvasItem::setY() and

    A canvas text item has text with font, color and alignment
    attributes. The text and font can be set in the constructor or set
    or changed later with setText() and setFont(). The color is set
    with setColor() and the alignment with setTextFlags(). The text
    item's bounding rectangle is retrieved with boundingRect().

    The text can be drawn on a painter with draw().

    Like any other canvas item text items can be moved with
    QCanvasItem::move() and QCanvasItem::moveBy(), or by setting
    coordinates with QCanvasItem::setX(), QCanvasItem::setY() and
    QCanvasItem::setZ().
