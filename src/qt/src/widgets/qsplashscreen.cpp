   \class QSplashScreen qsplashscreen.h
   \brief The QSplashScreen widget provides a splash screen that can
   be shown during application startup.

    \ingroup misc
    \mainclass

   A splash screen is a widget that is usually displayed when an
   application is being started. Splash screens are often used for
   applications that have long start up times (e.g. database or
   networking applications that take time to establish connections) to
   provide the user with feedback that the application is loading.

   The splash screen appears centered on the screen. It may be useful to add
   the \c WStyle_StaysOnTop if you desire to keep above all the windows in the
   GUI.

   Some X11 window managers do not support the "stays on top" flag. A
   solution is to set up a timer that periodically calls raise() on
   the splash screen to simulate the "stays on top" effect.

   The most common usage is to show a splash screen before the main
   widget is displayed on the screen. This is illustrated in the
   following code snippet.

   \code
   int main( int argc, char **argv )
   {
       QApplication app( argc, argv );
       QPixmap pixmap( "splash.png" );
       QSplashScreen *splash = new QSplashScreen( pixmap );
       splash->show();
       QMainWindow *mainWin = new QMainWindow;
       ...
       app.setMainWidget( mainWin );
       mainWin->show();
       splash->finish( mainWin );
       delete splash;
       return app.exec();
   }
   \endcode

   It is sometimes useful to update the splash screen with messages,
   for example, announcing connections established or modules loaded
   as the application starts up. QSplashScreen supports this with the
   message() function. If you wish to do your own drawing you can
   get a pointer to the pixmap used in the splash screen with pixmap().
   Alternatively, you can subclass QSplashScreen and reimplement
   drawContents().

   The user can hide the splash screen by clicking on it with the
   mouse. Since the splash screen is typically displayed before the
   event loop has started running, it is necessary to periodically
   call QApplication::processEvents() to receive the mouse clicks.

   \code
   QPixmap pixmap( "splash.png" );
   QSplashScreen *splash = new QSplashScreen( pixmap );
   splash->show();
   ... // Loading some items
   splash->message( "Loaded modules" );
   qApp->processEvents();
   ... // Establishing connections
   splash->message( "Established connections" );
   qApp->processEvents();
   \endcode
