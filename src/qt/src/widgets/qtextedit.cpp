    \brief The QTextEdit widget provides a powerful single-page rich text editor.

    \section1 Introduction and Concepts

    QTextEdit is an advanced WYSIWYG viewer/editor supporting rich
    text formatting using HTML-style tags. It is optimized to handle
    large documents and to respond quickly to user input.

    QTextEdit has four modes of operation:
    \table
    \header \i Mode \i Command \i Notes
    \row \i Plain Text Editor \i setTextFormat(PlainText)
	 \i Set text with setText(); text() returns plain text. Text
	 attributes (e.g. colors) can be set, but plain text is always
	 returned.
    \row \i Rich Text Editor \i setTextFormat(RichText)
	 \i Set text with setText(); text() returns rich text. Rich
	 text editing is fairly limited. You can't set margins or
	 insert images for example (although you can read and
	 correctly display files that have margins set and that
	 include images). This mode is mostly useful for editing small
	 amounts of rich text. <sup>1.</sup>
    \row \i Text Viewer \i setReadOnly(TRUE)
         \i Set text with setText() or append() (which has no undo
	 history so is faster and uses less memory); text() returns
	 plain or rich text depending on the textFormat(). This mode
	 can correctly display a large subset of HTML tags.
    \row \i Log Viewer \i setTextFormat(LogText)
	 \i Append text using append(). The widget is set to be read
	 only and rich text support is disabled although a few HTML
	 tags (for color, bold, italic and underline) may be used.
	 (See \link #logtextmode LogText mode\endlink for details.)
    \endtable

    <sup>1.</sup><small>A more complete API that supports setting
    margins, images, etc., is planned for a later Qt release.</small>

    QTextEdit can be used as a syntax highlighting editor when used in
    conjunction with QSyntaxHighlighter.

    We recommend that you always call setTextFormat() to set the mode
    you want to use. If you use \c AutoText then setText() and
    append() will try to determine whether the text they are given is
    plain text or rich text. If you use \c RichText then setText() and
    append() will assume that the text they are given is rich text.
    insert() simply inserts the text it is given.

    QTextEdit works on paragraphs and characters. A paragraph is a
    formatted string which is word-wrapped to fit into the width of
    the widget. By default when reading plain text, one newline
    signify a paragraph. A document consists of zero or more
    paragraphs, indexed from 0. Characters are indexed on a
    per-paragraph basis, also indexed from 0. The words in the
    paragraph are aligned in accordance with the paragraph's
    alignment(). Paragraphs are separated by hard line breaks. Each
    character within a paragraph has its own attributes, for example,
    font and color.

    The text edit documentation uses the following concepts:
    \list
    \i \e{current format} --
    this is the format at the current cursor position, \e and it
    is the format of the selected text if any.
    \i \e{current paragraph} -- the paragraph which contains the
    cursor.
    \endlist

    QTextEdit can display images (using QMimeSourceFactory), lists and
    tables. If the text is too large to view within the text edit's
    viewport, scrollbars will appear. The text edit can load both
    plain text and HTML files (a subset of HTML 3.2 and 4). The
    rendering style and the set of valid tags are defined by a
    styleSheet(). Custom tags can be created and placed in a custom
    style sheet. Change the style sheet with \l{setStyleSheet()}; see
    QStyleSheet for details. The images identified by image tags are
    displayed if they can be interpreted using the text edit's
    \l{QMimeSourceFactory}; see setMimeSourceFactory().

    If you want a text browser with more navigation use QTextBrowser.
    If you just need to display a small piece of rich text use QLabel
    or QSimpleRichText.

    If you create a new QTextEdit, and want to allow the user to edit
    rich text, call setTextFormat(Qt::RichText) to ensure that the
    text is treated as rich text. (Rich text uses HTML tags to set
    text formatting attributes. See QStyleSheet for information on the
    HTML tags that are supported.). If you don't call setTextFormat()
    explicitly the text edit will guess from the text itself whether
    it is rich text or plain text. This means that if the text looks
    like HTML or XML it will probably be interpreted as rich text, so
    you should call setTextFormat(Qt::PlainText) to preserve such
    text.

    Note that we do not intend to add a full-featured web browser
    widget to Qt (because that would easily double Qt's size and only
    a few applications would benefit from it). The rich
    text support in Qt is designed to provide a fast, portable and
    efficient way to add reasonable online help facilities to
    applications, and to provide a basis for rich text editors.

    \section1 Using QTextEdit as a Display Widget

    QTextEdit can display a large HTML subset, including tables and
    images.

    The text is set or replaced using setText() which deletes any
    existing text and replaces it with the text passed in the
    setText() call. If you call setText() with legacy HTML (with
    setTextFormat(RichText) in force), and then call text(), the text
    that is returned may have different markup, but will render the
    same. Text can be inserted with insert(), paste(), pasteSubType()
    and append(). Text that is appended does not go into the undo
    history; this makes append() faster and consumes less memory. Text
    can also be cut(). The entire text is deleted with clear() and the
    selected text is deleted with removeSelectedText(). Selected
    (marked) text can also be deleted with del() (which will delete
    the character to the right of the cursor if no text is selected).

    Loading and saving text is achieved using setText() and text(),
    for example:
    \code
    QFile file( fileName ); // Read the text from a file
    if ( file.open( IO_ReadOnly ) ) {
	QTextStream stream( &file );
	textEdit->setText( stream.read() );
    }

    QFile file( fileName ); // Write the text to a file
    if ( file.open( IO_WriteOnly ) ) {
	QTextStream stream( &file );
	stream << textEdit->text();
	textEdit->setModified( FALSE );
    }
    \endcode

    By default the text edit wraps words at whitespace to fit within
    the text edit widget. The setWordWrap() function is used to
    specify the kind of word wrap you want, or \c NoWrap if you don't
    want any wrapping. Call setWordWrap() to set a fixed pixel width
    \c FixedPixelWidth, or character column (e.g. 80 column) \c
    FixedColumnWidth with the pixels or columns specified with
    setWrapColumnOrWidth(). If you use word wrap to the widget's width
    \c WidgetWidth, you can specify whether to break on whitespace or
    anywhere with setWrapPolicy().

    The background color is set differently than other widgets, using
    setPaper(). You specify a brush style which could be a plain color
    or a complex pixmap.

    Hypertext links are automatically underlined; this can be changed
    with setLinkUnderline(). The tab stop width is set with
    setTabStopWidth().

    The zoomIn() and zoomOut() functions can be used to resize the
    text by increasing (decreasing for zoomOut()) the point size used.
    Images are not affected by the zoom functions.

    The lines() function returns the number of lines in the text and
    paragraphs() returns the number of paragraphs. The number of lines
    within a particular paragraph is returned by linesOfParagraph().
    The length of the entire text in characters is returned by
    length().

    You can scroll to an anchor in the text, e.g.
    \c{<a name="anchor">} with scrollToAnchor(). The find() function
    can be used to find and select a given string within the text.

    A read-only QTextEdit provides the same functionality as the
    (obsolete) QTextView. (QTextView is still supplied for
    compatibility with old code.)

    \section2 Read-only key bindings

    When QTextEdit is used read-only the key-bindings are limited to
    navigation, and text may only be selected with the mouse:
    \table
    \header \i Keypresses \i Action
    \row \i UpArrow	\i Move one line up
    \row \i DownArrow	\i Move one line down
    \row \i LeftArrow	\i Move one character left
    \row \i RightArrow	\i Move one character right
    \row \i PageUp	\i Move one (viewport) page up
    \row \i PageDown	\i Move one (viewport) page down
    \row \i Home	\i Move to the beginning of the text
    \row \i End		\i Move to the end of the text
    \row \i Shift+Wheel
	 \i Scroll the page horizontally (the Wheel is the mouse wheel)
    \row \i Ctrl+Wheel	\i Zoom the text
    \endtable

    The text edit may be able to provide some meta-information. For
    example, the documentTitle() function will return the text from
    within HTML \c{<title>} tags.

    The text displayed in a text edit has a \e context. The context is
    a path which the text edit's QMimeSourceFactory uses to resolve
    the locations of files and images. It is passed to the
    mimeSourceFactory() when quering data. (See QTextEdit() and
    \l{context()}.)

    \target logtextmode
    \section2 Using QTextEdit in LogText Mode

    Setting the text format to \c LogText puts the widget in a special
    mode which is optimized for very large texts. Editing, word wrap,
    and rich text support are disabled in this mode (the widget is
    explicitly made read-only). This allows the text to be stored in a
    different, more memory efficient manner. However, a certain degree
    of text formatting is supported through the use of formatting tags.
    A tag is delimited by \c < and \c {>}. The characters \c {<}, \c >
    and \c & are escaped by using \c {&lt;}, \c {&gt;} and \c {&amp;}.
    A tag pair consists of a left and a right tag (or open/close tags).
    Left-tags mark the starting point for formatting, while right-tags
    mark the ending point. A right-tag always start with a \c / before
    the tag keyword. For example \c <b> and \c </b> are a tag pair.
    Tags can be nested, but they have to be closed in the same order as
    they are opened. For example, \c <b><u></u></b> is valid, while \c
    <b><u></b></u> will output an error message.

    By using tags it is possible to change the color, bold, italic and
    underline settings for a piece of text. A color can be specified
    by using the HTML font tag \c {<font color=colorname>}. The color
    name can be one of the color names from the X11 color database, or
    a RGB hex value (e.g \c {#00ff00}). Example of valid color tags:
    \c {<font color=red>}, \c {<font color="light blue">}, \c {<font
    color="#223344">}. Bold, italic and underline settings can be
    specified by the tags \c {<b>}, \c <i> and \c {<u>}. Note that a
    tag does not necessarily have to be closed. A valid example:
    \code
    This is <font color=red>red</font> while <b>this</b> is <font color=blue>blue</font>.
    <font color=green><font color=yellow>Yellow,</font> and <u>green</u>.
    \endcode

    Stylesheets can also be used in LogText mode. To create and use a
    custom tag, you could do the following:
    \code
    QTextEdit * log = new QTextEdit( this );
    log->setTextFormat( Qt::LogText );
    QStyleSheetItem * item = new QStyleSheetItem( log->styleSheet(), "mytag" );
    item->setColor( "red" );
    item->setFontWeight( QFont::Bold );
    item->setFontUnderline( TRUE );
    log->append( "This is a <mytag>custom tag</mytag>!" );
    \endcode
    Note that only the color, bold, underline and italic attributes of
    a QStyleSheetItem is used in LogText mode.

    Note that you can use setMaxLogLines() to limit the number of
    lines the widget can hold in LogText mode.

    There are a few things that you need to be aware of when the
    widget is in this mode:
    \list
    \i Functions that deal with rich text formatting and cursor
    movement will not work or return anything valid.
    \i Lines are equivalent to paragraphs.
    \endlist

    \section1 Using QTextEdit as an Editor

    All the information about using QTextEdit as a display widget also
    applies here.

    The current format's attributes are set with setItalic(),
    setBold(), setUnderline(), setFamily() (font family),
    setPointSize(), setColor() and setCurrentFont(). The current
    paragraph's alignment is set with setAlignment().

    Use setSelection() to select text. The setSelectionAttributes()
    function is used to indicate how selected text should be
    displayed. Use hasSelectedText() to find out if any text is
    selected. The currently selected text's position is available
    using getSelection() and the selected text itself is returned by
    selectedText(). The selection can be copied to the clipboard with
    copy(), or cut to the clipboard with cut(). It can be deleted with
    removeSelectedText(). The entire text can be selected (or
    unselected) using selectAll(). QTextEdit supports multiple
    selections. Most of the selection functions operate on the default
    selection, selection 0. If the user presses a non-selecting key,
    e.g. a cursor key without also holding down Shift, all selections
    are cleared.

    Set and get the position of the cursor with setCursorPosition()
    and getCursorPosition() respectively. When the cursor is moved,
    the signals currentFontChanged(), currentColorChanged() and
    currentAlignmentChanged() are emitted to reflect the font, color
    and alignment at the new cursor position.

    If the text changes, the textChanged() signal is emitted, and if
    the user inserts a new line by pressing Return or Enter,
    returnPressed() is emitted. The isModified() function will return
    TRUE if the text has been modified.

    QTextEdit provides command-based undo and redo. To set the depth
    of the command history use setUndoDepth() which defaults to 100
    steps. To undo or redo the last operation call undo() or redo().
    The signals undoAvailable() and redoAvailable() indicate whether
    the undo and redo operations can be executed.

    The indent() function is used to reindent a paragraph. It is
    useful for code editors, for example in \link designer-manual.book
    Qt Designer\endlink's code editor \e{Ctrl+I} invokes the indent()
    function.

    \section2 Editing key bindings

    The list of key-bindings which are implemented for editing:
    \table
    \header \i Keypresses \i Action
    \row \i Backspace \i Delete the character to the left of the cursor
    \row \i Delete \i Delete the character to the right of the cursor
    \row \i Ctrl+A \i Move the cursor to the beginning of the line
    \row \i Ctrl+B \i Move the cursor one character left
    \row \i Ctrl+C \i Copy the marked text to the clipboard (also
		      Ctrl+Insert under Windows)
    \row \i Ctrl+D \i Delete the character to the right of the cursor
    \row \i Ctrl+E \i Move the cursor to the end of the line
    \row \i Ctrl+F \i Move the cursor one character right
    \row \i Ctrl+H \i Delete the character to the left of the cursor
    \row \i Ctrl+K \i Delete to end of line
    \row \i Ctrl+N \i Move the cursor one line down
    \row \i Ctrl+P \i Move the cursor one line up
    \row \i Ctrl+V \i Paste the clipboard text into line edit
		      (also Shift+Insert under Windows)
    \row \i Ctrl+X \i Cut the marked text, copy to clipboard
		      (also Shift+Delete under Windows)
    \row \i Ctrl+Z \i Undo the last operation
    \row \i Ctrl+Y \i Redo the last operation
    \row \i LeftArrow	    \i Move the cursor one character left
    \row \i Ctrl+LeftArrow  \i Move the cursor one word left
    \row \i RightArrow	    \i Move the cursor one character right
    \row \i Ctrl+RightArrow \i Move the cursor one word right
    \row \i UpArrow	    \i Move the cursor one line up
    \row \i Ctrl+UpArrow    \i Move the cursor one word up
    \row \i DownArrow	    \i Move the cursor one line down
    \row \i Ctrl+Down Arrow \i Move the cursor one word down
    \row \i PageUp	    \i Move the cursor one page up
    \row \i PageDown	    \i Move the cursor one page down
    \row \i Home	    \i Move the cursor to the beginning of the line
    \row \i Ctrl+Home	    \i Move the cursor to the beginning of the text
    \row \i End		    \i Move the cursor to the end of the line
    \row \i Ctrl+End	    \i Move the cursor to the end of the text
    \row \i Shift+Wheel	    \i Scroll the page horizontally
			    (the Wheel is the mouse wheel)
    \row \i Ctrl+Wheel	    \i Zoom the text
    \endtable

    To select (mark) text hold down the Shift key whilst pressing one
    of the movement keystrokes, for example, \e{Shift+Right Arrow}
    will select the character to the right, and \e{Shift+Ctrl+Right
    Arrow} will select the word to the right, etc.

    By default the text edit widget operates in insert mode so all
    text that the user enters is inserted into the text edit and any
    text to the right of the cursor is moved out of the way. The mode
    can be changed to overwrite, where new text overwrites any text to
    the right of the cursor, using setOverwriteMode().

    \value ActionDelete  Delete the character to the right of the
    cursor.

    \value ActionReturn  Split the paragraph at the cursor position.

    \value ActionKill If the cursor is not at the end of the
    paragraph, delete the text from the cursor position until the end
    of the paragraph. If the cursor is at the end of the paragraph,
    delete the hard line break at the end of the paragraph: this will
    cause this paragraph to be joined with the following paragraph.

    to TRUE. If no text has been selected or if the selected text is
    de-selected this signal is emitted with \a yes set to FALSE.

    If \a yes is TRUE then copy() can be used to copy the selection to
    the clipboard. If \a yes is FALSE then copy() does nothing.

    \sa selectionChanged()

/*! \internal

  Find tags in \a line, remove them from \a line and put them in a
  structure.

  A tag is delimited by '<' and '>'. The characters '<', '>' and '&'
  are escaped by using '&lt;', '&gt;' and '&amp;'. Left-tags marks
  the starting point for formatting, while right-tags mark the ending
  point. A right-tag is the same as a left-tag, but with a '/'
  appearing before the tag keyword.  E.g a valid left-tag: <b>, and
  a valid right-tag: </b>.  Tags can be nested, but they have to be
  closed in the same order as they are opened. E.g:
  <font color=red><font color=blue>blue</font>red</font> - is valid, while:
  <font color=red><b>bold red</font> just bold</b> - is invalid since the font tag is
  closed before the bold tag. Note that a tag does not have to be
  closed: '<font color=blue>Lots of text - and then some..'  is perfectly valid for
  setting all text appearing after the tag to blue.  A tag can be used
  to change the color of a piece of text, or set one of the following
  formatting attributes: bold, italic and underline.  These attributes
  are set using the <b>, <i> and <u> tags.  Example of valid tags:
  <font color=red>, </font>, <b>, <u>, <i>, </i>.
  Example of valid text:
  This is some <font color=red>red text</font>, while this is some <font color=green>green
  text</font>. <font color=blue><font color=yellow>This is yellow</font>, while this is
  blue.</font>

  Note that only the color attribute of the HTML font tag is supported.

  Limitations:
  1. A tag cannot span several lines.
  2. Very limited error checking - mismatching left/right-tags is the
  only thing that is detected.
