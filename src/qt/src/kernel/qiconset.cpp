/*! \class QIconSet

  \brief The QIconSet class provides a set of icons with different
  styles and sizes.

  \ingroup graphics
  \ingroup images
  \ingroup shared
  \mainclass

  A QIconSet can generate smaller, larger, active, and disabled pixmaps
  from the set of icons it is given. Such pixmaps are used by
  QToolButton, QHeader, QPopupMenu, etc. to show an icon representing a
  particular action.

  The simplest use of QIconSet is to create one from a QPixmap and then
  use it, allowing Qt to work out all the required icon styles and
  sizes. For example:

  \code
    QToolButton *but = new QToolButton( QIconSet( QPixmap("open.xpm") ), ... );
  \endcode

  Using whichever pixmaps you specify as a base, QIconSet provides a
  set of six icons, each with a \l Size and a \l Mode: Small Normal,
  Small Disabled, Small Active, Large Normal, Large Disabled, and
  Large Active.

  An additional set of six icons can be provided for widgets that have
  an "On" or "Off" state, like checkable menu items or toggleable
  toolbuttons. If you provide pixmaps for the "On" state, but not for
  the "Off" state, the QIconSet will provide the "Off" pixmaps. You may
  specify icons for both states in you wish.

  You can set any of the icons using setPixmap().

  When you retrieve a pixmap using pixmap(Size, Mode, State),
  QIconSet will return the icon that has been set or previously
  generated for that size, mode and state combination. If none is
  available, QIconSet will ask the icon factory. If the icon factory
  cannot provide any (the default), QIconSet generates a pixmap based
  on the pixmaps it has been given and returns it.

  The \c Disabled appearance is computed using an algorithm that
  produces results very similar to those used in Microsoft Windows
  95. The \c Active appearance is identical to the \c Normal
  appearance unless you use setPixmap() to set it to something
  special.

  When scaling icons, QIconSet uses \link QImage::smoothScale()
  smooth scaling\endlink, which can partially blend the color component
  of pixmaps.  If the results look poor, the best solution
  is to supply pixmaps in both large and small sizes.

  You can use the static function setIconSize() to set the preferred
  size of the generated large/small icons. The default small size is
  22 x 22, while the default large size is 32 x 32. These sizes only
  affect generated icons.

  The isGenerated() function returns TRUE if an icon was generated by
  QIconSet or by a factory; clearGenerated() clears all cached
  pixmaps.

  \section1 Making Classes that Use QIconSet

  If you write your own widgets that have an option to set a small
  pixmap, consider allowing a QIconSet to be set for that pixmap.  The
  Qt class QToolButton is an example of such a widget.

  Provide a method to set a QIconSet, and when you draw the icon, choose
  whichever icon is appropriate for the current state of your widget.
  For example:
  \code
    void MyWidget::drawIcon( QPainter* p, QPoint pos )
    {
	p->drawPixmap( pos, icons->pixmap(
				QIconSet::Small,
				isEnabled() ? QIconSet::Normal :
					      QIconSet::Disabled,
				isEnabled() ? QIconSet::On :
					      QIconSet::Off));
    }
  \endcode

  You might also make use of the \c Active mode, perhaps making your
  widget \c Active when the mouse is over the widget (see \l
  QWidget::enterEvent()), while the mouse is pressed pending the
  release that will activate the function, or when it is the currently
  selected item. If the widget can be toggled, the "On" mode might be
  used to draw a different icon.

/*!
  \enum QIconSet::Size

  This enum type describes the size at which a pixmap is intended to be
  used.
  The currently defined sizes are:

    \value Automatic  The size of the pixmap is determined from its
		      pixel size. This is a useful default.
    \value Small  The pixmap is the smaller of two.
    \value Large  The pixmap is the larger of two.

  If a Small pixmap is not set by QIconSet::setPixmap(), the Large
  pixmap will be automatically scaled down to the size of a small pixmap
  to generate the Small pixmap when required.  Similarly, a Small pixmap
  will be automatically scaled up to generate a Large pixmap. The
  preferred sizes for large/small generated icons can be set using
  setIconSize().

/*!
  \enum QIconSet::Mode

  This enum type describes the mode for which a pixmap is intended to be
  used.
  The currently defined modes are:

    \value Normal
	 Display the pixmap when the user is
	not interacting with the icon, but the
	functionality represented by the icon is available.
    \value Disabled
	 Display the pixmap when the
	functionality represented by the icon is not available.
    \value Active
	 Display the pixmap when the
	functionality represented by the icon is available and
	the user is interacting with the icon, for example, moving the
	mouse over it or clicking it.

/*! \class QIconFactory

  \brief The QIconFactory class is used to create pixmaps for a QIconSet.

  By reimplementing createPixmap(), you can override QIconSet's
  default algorithm for computing pixmaps not supplied by the user.

  Call setAutoDelete(TRUE) if you want the factory to automatically
  delete itself when it is no longer needed by QIconSet.

  Ceates a pixmap for \a iconSet with a certain \a size, \a mode, and
