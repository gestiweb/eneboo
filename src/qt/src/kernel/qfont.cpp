      QFontDef comparison is more complicated than just simple
      per-member comparisons.

      When comparing point/pixel sizes, either point or pixelsize
      could be -1.  in This case we have to compare the non negative
      size value.

      This test will fail if the point-sizes differ by 1/2 point or
      more or they do not round to the same value.  We have to do this
      since our API still uses 'int' point-sizes in the API, but store
      deci-point-sizes internally.

      To compare the family members, we need to parse the font names
      and compare the family/foundry strings separately.  This allows
      us to compare e.g. "Helvetica" and "Helvetica [Adobe]" with
      positive results.

    \class QFont qfont.h
    \brief The QFont class specifies a font used for drawing text.

    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup appearance
    \ingroup shared
    \mainclass

    When you create a QFont object you specify various attributes that
    you want the font to have. Qt will use the font with the specified
    attributes, or if no matching font exists, Qt will use the closest
    matching installed font. The attributes of the font that is
    actually used are retrievable from a QFontInfo object. If the
    window system provides an exact match exactMatch() returns TRUE.
    Use QFontMetrics to get measurements, e.g. the pixel length of a
    string using QFontMetrics::width().

    Use QApplication::setFont() to set the application's default font.

    If a choosen X11 font does not include all the characters that
    need to be displayed, QFont will try to find the characters in the
    nearest equivalent fonts. When a QPainter draws a character from a
    font the QFont will report whether or not it has the character; if
    it does not, QPainter will draw an unfilled square.

    Create QFonts like this:
    \code
    QFont serifFont( "Times", 10, Bold );
    QFont sansFont( "Helvetica [Cronyx]", 12 );
    \endcode

    The attributes set in the constructor can also be set later, e.g.
    setFamily(), setPointSize(), setPointSizeFloat(), setWeight() and
    setItalic(). The remaining attributes must be set after
    contstruction, e.g. setBold(), setUnderline(), setOverline(),
    setStrikeOut() and setFixedPitch(). QFontInfo objects should be
    created \e after the font's attributes have been set. A QFontInfo
    object will not change, even if you change the font's
    attributes. The corresponding "get" functions, e.g. family(),
    pointSize(), etc., return the values that were set, even though
    the values used may differ. The actual values are available from a
    QFontInfo object.

    If the requested font family is unavailable you can influence the
    \link #fontmatching font matching algorithm\endlink by choosing a
    particular \l{QFont::StyleHint} and \l{QFont::StyleStrategy} with
    setStyleHint(). The default family (corresponding to the current
    style hint) is returned by defaultFamily().

    The font-matching algorithm has a lastResortFamily() and
    lastResortFont() in cases where a suitable match cannot be found.
    You can provide substitutions for font family names using
    insertSubstitution() and insertSubstitutions(). Substitutions can
    be removed with removeSubstitution(). Use substitute() to retrieve
    a family's first substitute, or the family name itself if it has
    no substitutes. Use substitutes() to retrieve a list of a family's
    substitutes (which may be empty).

    Every QFont has a key() which you can use, for example, as the key
    in a cache or dictionary. If you want to store a user's font
    preferences you could use QSettings, writing the font information
    with toString() and reading it back with fromString(). The
    operator<<() and operator>>() functions are also available, but
    they work on a data stream.

    It is possible to set the height of characters shown on the screen
    to a specified number of pixels with setPixelSize(); however using
    setPointSize() has a similar effect and provides device
    independence.

    Under the X Window System you can set a font using its system
    specific name with setRawName().

    Loading fonts can be expensive, especially on X11. QFont contains
    extensive optimizations to make the copying of QFont objects fast,
    and to cache the results of the slow window system functions it
    depends upon.

    \target fontmatching
    The font matching algorithm works as follows:
    \list 1
    \i The specified font family is searched for.
    \i If not found, the styleHint() is used to select a replacement
       family.
    \i Each replacement font family is searched for.
    \i If none of these are found or there was no styleHint(), "helvetica"
       will be searched for.
    \i If "helvetica" isn't found Qt will try the lastResortFamily().
    \i If the lastResortFamily() isn't found Qt will try the
       lastResortFont() which will always return a name of some kind.
    \endlist

    Once a font is found, the remaining attributes are matched in order of
    priority:
    \list 1
    \i fixedPitch()
    \i pointSize() (see below)
    \i weight()
    \i italic()
    \endlist

    If you have a font which matches on family, even if none of the
    other attributes match, this font will be chosen in preference to
    a font which doesn't match on family but which does match on the
    other attributes. This is because font family is the dominant
    search criteria.

    The point size is defined to match if it is within 20% of the
    requested point size. When several fonts match and are only
    distinguished by point size, the font with the closest point size
    to the one requested will be chosen.

    The actual family, font size, weight and other font attributes
    used for drawing text will depend on what's available for the
    chosen family under the window system. A QFontInfo object can be
    used to determine the actual values used for drawing the text.

    Examples:

    \code
    QFont f("Helvetica");
    \endcode
    If you had both an Adobe and a Cronyx Helvetica, you might get
    either.

    \code
    QFont f1( "Helvetica [Cronyx]" );  // Qt 3.x
    QFont f2( "Cronyx-Helvetica" );    // Qt 2.x compatibility
    \endcode
    You can specify the foundry you want in the family name. Both fonts,
    f1 and f2, in the above example will be set to  "Helvetica
    [Cronyx]".

    To determine the attributes of the font actually used in the window
    system, use a QFontInfo object, e.g.
    \code
    QFontInfo info( f1 );
    QString family = info.family();
    \endcode

    To find out font metrics use a QFontMetrics object, e.g.
    \code
    QFontMetrics fm( f1 );
    int pixelWidth = fm.width( "How many pixels wide is this text?" );
    int pixelHeight = fm.height();
    \endcode

    \class QFontMetrics qfontmetrics.h
    \brief The QFontMetrics class provides font metrics information.

    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup shared

    QFontMetrics functions calculate the size of characters and
    strings for a given font. There are three ways you can create a
    QFontMetrics object:

    \list 1
    \i Calling the QFontMetrics constructor with a QFont creates a
    font metrics object for a screen-compatible font, i.e. the font
    cannot be a printer font<sup>*</sup>. If the font is changed
    later, the font metrics object is \e not updated.

    \i QWidget::fontMetrics() returns the font metrics for a widget's
    font. This is equivalent to QFontMetrics(widget->font()). If the
    widget's font is changed later, the font metrics object is \e not
    updated.

    \i QPainter::fontMetrics() returns the font metrics for a
    painter's current font. If the painter's font is changed later, the
    font metrics object is \e not updated.
    \endlist

    <sup>*</sup> If you use a printer font the values returned may be
    inaccurate. Printer fonts are not always accessible so the nearest
    screen font is used if a printer font is supplied.

    Once created, the object provides functions to access the
    individual metrics of the font, its characters, and for strings
    rendered in the font.

    There are several functions that operate on the font: ascent(),
    descent(), height(), leading() and lineSpacing() return the basic
    size properties of the font. The underlinePos(), overlinePos(),
    strikeOutPos() and lineWidth() functions, return the properties of
    the line that underlines, overlines or strikes out the
    characters. These functions are all fast.

    There are also some functions that operate on the set of glyphs in
    the font: minLeftBearing(), minRightBearing() and maxWidth().
    These are by necessity slow, and we recommend avoiding them if
    possible.

    For each character, you can get its width(), leftBearing() and
    rightBearing() and find out whether it is in the font using
    inFont(). You can also treat the character as a string, and use
    the string functions on it.

    The string functions include width(), to return the width of a
    string in pixels (or points, for a printer), boundingRect(), to
    return a rectangle large enough to contain the rendered string,
    and size(), to return the size of that rectangle.

    Example:
    \code
    QFont font( "times", 24 );
    QFontMetrics fm( font );
    int pixelsWide = fm.width( "What's the width of this text?" );
    int pixelsHigh = fm.height();
    \endcode

    \sa QFont QFontInfo QFontDatabase
*/

    The font must be screen-compatible, i.e. a font you use when
    drawing text in \link QWidget widgets\endlink or \link QPixmap
    pixmaps\endlink, not QPicture or QPrinter.

    The font metrics object holds the information for the font that is
    passed in the constructor at the time it is created, and is not
    updated if the font's attributes are changed later.

  Use QPainter::fontMetrics() to get the font metrics when painting.
  This will give correct results also when painting on paint device
  that is not screen-compatible.

    Returns the bounding rectangle of the first \a len characters of
    \a str, which is the set of pixels the text would cover if drawn
    at (0, 0). The drawing, and hence the bounding rectangle, is
    constrained to the rectangle (\a x, \a y, \a w, \a h).

    If \a len is negative (which is the default), the entire string is
    used.

    The \a flgs argument is the bitwise OR of the following flags:
    \list
    \i \c AlignAuto aligns to the left border for all languages except
	  Arabic and Hebrew where it aligns to the right.
    \i \c AlignLeft aligns to the left border.
    \i \c AlignRight aligns to the right border.
    \i \c AlignJustify produces justified text.
    \i \c AlignHCenter aligns horizontally centered.
    \i \c AlignTop aligns to the top border.
    \i \c AlignBottom aligns to the bottom border.
    \i \c AlignVCenter aligns vertically centered
    \i \c AlignCenter (== \c{AlignHCenter | AlignVCenter})
    \i \c SingleLine ignores newline characters in the text.
    \i \c ExpandTabs expands tabs (see below)
    \i \c ShowPrefix interprets "&amp;x" as "<u>x</u>", i.e. underlined.
    \i \c WordBreak breaks the text to fit the rectangle.
    \endlist

    Horizontal alignment defaults to \c AlignAuto and vertical
    alignment defaults to \c AlignTop.

    If several of the horizontal or several of the vertical alignment
    flags are set, the resulting alignment is undefined.

    These flags are defined in \c qnamespace.h.

    If \c ExpandTabs is set in \a flgs, then: if \a tabarray is
    non-null, it specifies a 0-terminated sequence of pixel-positions
    for tabs; otherwise if \a tabstops is non-zero, it is used as the
    tab spacing (in pixels).

    Note that the bounding rectangle may extend to the left of (0, 0),
    e.g. for italicized fonts, and that the text output may cover \e
    all pixels in the bounding rectangle.

    Newline characters are processed as linebreaks.

    Despite the different actual character heights, the heights of the
    bounding rectangles of "Yes" and "yes" are the same.

    The bounding rectangle given by this function is somewhat larger
    than that calculated by the simpler boundingRect() function. This
    function uses the \link minLeftBearing() maximum left \endlink and
    \link minRightBearing() right \endlink font bearings as is
    necessary for multi-line text to align correctly. Also,
    fontHeight() and lineSpacing() are used to calculate the height,
    rather than individual character heights.

    The \a intern argument should not be used.

    \class QFontInfo qfontinfo.h

    \brief The QFontInfo class provides general information about fonts.

    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup shared

    The QFontInfo class provides the same access functions as QFont,
    e.g. family(), pointSize(), italic(), weight(), fixedPitch(),
    styleHint() etc. But whilst the QFont access functions return the
    values that were set, a QFontInfo object returns the values that
    apply to the font that will actually be used to draw the text.

    For example, when the program asks for a 25pt Courier font on a
    machine that has a non-scalable 24pt Courier font, QFont will
    (normally) use the 24pt Courier for rendering. In this case,
    QFont::pointSize() returns 25 and QFontInfo::pointSize() returns
    24.

    There are three ways to create a QFontInfo object.
    \list 1
    \i Calling the QFontInfo constructor with a QFont creates a font
    info object for a screen-compatible font, i.e. the font cannot be
    a printer font<sup>*</sup>. If the font is changed later, the font
    info object is \e not updated.

    \i QWidget::fontInfo() returns the font info for a widget's font.
    This is equivalent to calling QFontInfo(widget->font()). If the
    widget's font is changed later, the font info object is \e not
    updated.

    \i QPainter::fontInfo() returns the font info for a painter's
    current font. If the painter's font is changed later, the font
    info object is \e not updated.
    \endlist

    <sup>*</sup> If you use a printer font the values returned may be
    inaccurate. Printer fonts are not always accessible so the nearest
    screen font is used if a printer font is supplied.

    \sa QFont QFontMetrics QFontDatabase
*/

/*!
    Constructs a font info object for \a font.

    The font must be screen-compatible, i.e. a font you use when
    drawing text in \link QWidget widgets\endlink or \link QPixmap
    pixmaps\endlink, not QPicture or QPrinter.

    The font info object holds the information for the font that is
    passed in the constructor at the time it is created, and is not
    updated if the font's attributes are changed later.

    Use QPainter::fontInfo() to get the font info when painting.
    This will give correct results also when painting on paint device
    that is not screen-compatible.
