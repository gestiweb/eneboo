    \class QPainter qpainter.h
    \brief The QPainter class does low-level painting e.g. on widgets.

    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup images
    \mainclass

    The painter provides highly optimized functions to do most of the
    drawing GUI programs require. QPainter can draw everything from
    simple lines to complex shapes like pies and chords. It can also
    draw aligned text and pixmaps. Normally, it draws in a "natural"
    coordinate system, but it can also do view and world
    transformation.

    The typical use of a painter is:

    \list
    \i Construct a painter.
    \i Set a pen, a brush etc.
    \i Draw.
    \i Destroy the painter.
    \endlist

    Mostly, all this is done inside a paint event. (In fact, 99% of
    all QPainter use is in a reimplementation of
    QWidget::paintEvent(), and the painter is heavily optimized for
    such use.) Here's one very simple example:

    \code
    void SimpleExampleWidget::paintEvent()
    {
  QPainter paint( this );
  paint.setPen( Qt::blue );
  paint.drawText( rect(), AlignCenter, "The Text" );
    }
    \endcode

    Usage is simple, and there are many settings you can use:

    \list

    \i font() is the currently set font. If you set a font that isn't
    available, Qt finds a close match. In fact font() returns what
    you set using setFont() and fontInfo() returns the font actually
    being used (which may be the same).

    \i brush() is the currently set brush; the color or pattern that's
    used for filling e.g. circles.

    \i pen() is the currently set pen; the color or stipple that's
    used for drawing lines or boundaries.

    \i backgroundMode() is \c Opaque or \c Transparent, i.e. whether
    backgroundColor() is used or not.

    \i backgroundColor() only applies when backgroundMode() is Opaque
    and pen() is a stipple. In that case, it describes the color of
    the background pixels in the stipple.

    \i rasterOp() is how pixels drawn interact with the pixels already
    there.

    \i brushOrigin() is the origin of the tiled brushes, normally the
    origin of the window.

    \i viewport(), window(), worldMatrix() and many more make up the
    painter's coordinate transformation system. See \link
    coordsys.html The Coordinate System \endlink for an explanation of
    this, or see below for a very brief overview of the functions.

    \i hasClipping() is whether the painter clips at all. (The paint
    device clips, too.) If the painter clips, it clips to clipRegion().

    \i pos() is the current position, set by moveTo() and used by
    lineTo().

    \endlist

    Note that some of these settings mirror settings in some paint
    devices, e.g. QWidget::font(). QPainter::begin() (or the QPainter
    constructor) copies these attributes from the paint device.
    Calling, for example, QWidget::setFont() doesn't take effect until
    the next time a painter begins painting on it.

    save() saves all of these settings on an internal stack, restore()
    pops them back.

    The core functionality of QPainter is drawing, and there are
    functions to draw most primitives: drawPoint(), drawPoints(),
    drawLine(), drawRect(), drawWinFocusRect(), drawRoundRect(),
    drawEllipse(), drawArc(), drawPie(), drawChord(),
    drawLineSegments(), drawPolyline(), drawPolygon(),
    drawConvexPolygon() and drawCubicBezier(). All of these functions
    take integer coordinates; there are no floating-point versions
    since we want drawing to be as fast as possible.

    There are functions to draw pixmaps/images, namely drawPixmap(),
    drawImage() and drawTiledPixmap(). drawPixmap() and drawImage()
    produce the same result, except that drawPixmap() is faster
    on-screen and drawImage() faster and sometimes better on QPrinter
    and QPicture.

    Text drawing is done using drawText(), and when you need
    fine-grained positioning, boundingRect() tells you where a given
    drawText() command would draw.

    There is a drawPicture() function that draws the contents of an
    entire QPicture using this painter. drawPicture() is the only
    function that disregards all the painter's settings: the QPicture
    has its own settings.

    Normally, the QPainter operates on the device's own coordinate
    system (usually pixels), but QPainter has good support for
    coordinate transformation. See \link coordsys.html The Coordinate
    System \endlink for a more general overview and a simple example.

    The most common functions used are scale(), rotate(), translate()
    and shear(), all of which operate on the worldMatrix().
    setWorldMatrix() can replace or add to the currently set
    worldMatrix().

    setViewport() sets the rectangle on which QPainter operates. The
    default is the entire device, which is usually fine, except on
    printers. setWindow() sets the coordinate system, that is, the
    rectangle that maps to viewport(). What's drawn inside the
    window() ends up being inside the viewport(). The window's
    default is the same as the viewport, and if you don't use the
    transformations, they are optimized away, gaining another little
    bit of speed.

    After all the coordinate transformation is done, QPainter can clip
    the drawing to an arbitrary rectangle or region. hasClipping() is
    TRUE if QPainter clips, and clipRegion() returns the clip region.
    You can set it using either setClipRegion() or setClipRect().
    Note that the clipping can be slow. It's all system-dependent,
    but as a rule of thumb, you can assume that drawing speed is
    inversely proportional to the number of rectangles in the clip
    region.

    After QPainter's clipping, the paint device may also clip. For
    example, most widgets clip away the pixels used by child widgets,
    and most printers clip away an area near the edges of the paper.
    This additional clipping is not reflected by the return value of
    clipRegion() or hasClipping().

    QPainter also includes some less-used functions that are very
    useful on those occasions when they're needed.

    isActive() indicates whether the painter is active. begin() (and
    the most usual constructor) makes it active. end() (and the
    destructor) deactivates it. If the painter is active, device()
    returns the paint device on which the painter paints.

    Sometimes it is desirable to make someone else paint on an unusual
    QPaintDevice. QPainter supports a static function to do this,
    redirect(). We recommend not using it, but for some hacks it's
    perfect.

    setTabStops() and setTabArray() can change where the tab stops
    are, but these are very seldomly used.

    \warning Note that QPainter does not attempt to work around
    coordinate limitations in the underlying window system. Some
    platforms may behave incorrectly with coordinates as small as
    +/-4000.

    This enum type is used to describe the way things are written to
    the paint device. Each bit of the \e src (what you write)
    interacts with the corresponding bit of the \e dst pixel.

    \value CopyROP  dst = src
    \value OrROP   dst = src OR dst
    \value XorROP   dst = src XOR dst
    \value NotAndROP  dst = (NOT src) AND dst

    By far the most useful ones are \c CopyROP and \c XorROP.

    On Qt/Embedded, only \c CopyROP, \c XorROP, and \c NotROP are supported.
*/

/*!
    \enum Qt::AlignmentFlags

    This enum type is used to describe alignment. It contains
    horizontal and vertical flags.

    The horizontal flags are:

    \value AlignAuto Aligns according to the language. Left for most,
  right for Arabic and Hebrew.
    \value AlignLeft Aligns with the left edge.
    \value AlignRight Aligns with the right edge.
    \value AlignHCenter Centers horizontally in the available space.
    \value AlignJustify Justifies the text in the available space.
  Does not work for everything and may be interpreted as
  AlignAuto in some cases.

    The vertical flags are:

    \value AlignTop Aligns with the top.
    \value AlignBottom Aligns with the bottom.
    \value AlignVCenter Centers vertically in the available space.

    You can use only one of the horizontal flags at a time. There is
    one two-dimensional flag:

    \value AlignCenter Centers in both dimensions.

    You can use at most one horizontal and one vertical flag at a time. \c
    AlignCenter counts as both horizontal and vertical.

    Masks:

    \value AlignHorizontal_Mask
    \value AlignVertical_Mask

    Conflicting combinations of flags have undefined meanings.
*/

/*!
    \enum Qt::TextFlags

    This enum type is used to define some modifier flags. Some of
    these flags only make sense in the context of printing:

    \value SingleLine Treats all whitespace as spaces and prints just
  one line.
    \value DontClip If it's impossible to stay within the given bounds,
  it prints outside.
    \value ExpandTabs Makes the U+0009 (ASCII tab) character move to
  the next tab stop.
    \value ShowPrefix Displays the string "\&P" as <u>P</u>
  (see QButton for an example). For an ampersand, use "\&\&".
    \value WordBreak Breaks lines at appropriate points, e.g. at word
  boundaries.
    \value BreakAnywhere Breaks lines anywhere, even within words.
    \value NoAccel Same as ShowPrefix but doesn't draw the underlines.

    You can use as many modifier flags as you want, except that \c
    SingleLine and \c WordBreak cannot be combined.

    Flags that are inappropriate for a given use (e.g. ShowPrefix to
    QGridLayout::addWidget()) are generally ignored.

*/

/*!
    \enum Qt::PenStyle

    This enum type defines the pen styles that can be drawn using
    QPainter. The styles are

    \value NoPen  no line at all. For example, QPainter::drawRect()
    fills but does not draw any boundary line.

    \value SolidLine  a simple line.

    \value DashLine  dashes separated by a few pixels.

    \value DotLine  dots separated by a few pixels.

    \value DashDotLine  alternate dots and dashes.

    \value DashDotDotLine  one dash, two dots, one dash, two dots.

    \value MPenStyle mask of the pen styles.

/*!
    \enum Qt::PenCapStyle

    This enum type defines the pen cap styles supported by Qt, i.e.
    the line end caps that can be drawn using QPainter.

    \value FlatCap  a square line end that does not cover the end
  point of the line.
    \value SquareCap  a square line end that covers the end point and
  extends beyond it with half the line width.
    \value RoundCap  a rounded line end.
    \value MPenCapStyle mask of the pen cap styles.

/*!
    \enum Qt::PenJoinStyle

    This enum type defines the pen join styles supported by Qt, i.e.
    which joins between two connected lines can be drawn using
    QPainter.

    \value MiterJoin  The outer edges of the lines are extended to
  meet at an angle, and this area is filled.
    \value BevelJoin  The triangular notch between the two lines is filled.
    \value RoundJoin  A circular arc between the two lines is filled.
    \value MPenJoinStyle mask of the pen join styles.

QPainter::QPainter()

/*!
    Constructs a painter that begins painting the paint device \a pd
    immediately. Depending on the underlying graphic system the
    painter will paint over children of the paintdevice if \a
    unclipped is TRUE.

    This constructor is convenient for short-lived painters, e.g. in a
    \link QWidget::paintEvent() paint event\endlink and should be used
    only once. The constructor calls begin() for you and the QPainter
    destructor automatically calls end().

    Here's an example using begin() and end():
    \code
  void MyWidget::paintEvent( QPaintEvent * )
  {
      QPainter p;
      p.begin( this );
      p.drawLine( ... );  // drawing code
      p.end();
  }
    \endcode

    The same example using this constructor:
    \code
  void MyWidget::paintEvent( QPaintEvent * )
  {
      QPainter p( this );
      p.drawLine( ... );  // drawing code
  }
    \endcode

    Since the constructor cannot provide feedback when the initialization
    of the painter failed you should rather use begin() and end() to paint
    on external devices, e.g. printers.

    \sa begin(), end()

    \overload bool QPainter::begin( const QPaintDevice *pd, const QWidget *copyAttributes, bool unclipped )

    This version opens the painter on a paint device \a pd and sets
    the initial pen, background color and font from \a copyAttributes,
    painting over the paint device's children when \a unclipped is
    TRUE. This is equivalent to:

    \code
  QPainter p;
  p.begin( pd );
  p.setPen( copyAttributes->foregroundColor() );
  p.setBackgroundColor( copyAttributes->backgroundColor() );
  p.setFont( copyAttributes->font() );
    \endcode

    This begin function is convenient for double buffering. When you
    draw in a pixmap instead of directly in a widget (to later bitBlt
    the pixmap into the widget) you will need to set the widget's
    font etc. This function does exactly that.

    Example:
    \code
  void MyWidget::paintEvent( QPaintEvent * )
  {
      QPixmap pm(size());
      QPainter p;
      p.begin(&pm, this);
      // ... potentially flickering paint operation ...
      p.end();
      bitBlt(this, 0, 0, &pm);

    If \a m is the identity matrix and \a combine is FALSE, this
    function calls setWorldXForm(FALSE). (The identity matrix is the
    matrix where QWMatrix::m11() and QWMatrix::m22() are 1.0 and the
    rest are 0.0.)

    World transformations are applied after the view transformations
    (i.e. \link setWindow() window\endlink and \link setViewport()
    viewport\endlink).

    The following functions can transform the coordinate system without using
    a QWMatrix:
    \list
    \i translate()
    \i scale()
    \i shear()
    \i rotate()
    \endlist

    They operate on the painter's worldMatrix() and are implemented like this:

    \code
  void QPainter::rotate( double a )
  {
      QWMatrix m;
      m.rotate( a );
      setWorldMatrix( m, TRUE );
  }
    \endcode

    Note that you should always use \a combine when you are drawing
    into a QPicture. Otherwise it may not be possible to replay the
    picture with additional transformations. Using translate(),
    scale(), etc., is safe.

    \class QPen qpen.h
    \brief The QPen class defines how a QPainter should draw lines and outlines
    of shapes.

    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup images
    \ingroup shared
    \mainclass

    A pen has a style, width, color, cap style and join style.

    The pen style defines the line type. The default pen style is \c
    Qt::SolidLine. Setting the style to \c NoPen tells the painter to
    not draw lines or outlines.

    When drawing 1 pixel wide diagonal lines you can either use a very
    fast algorithm (specified by a line width of 0, which is the
    default), or a slower but more accurate algorithm (specified by a
    line width of 1). For horizontal and vertical lines a line width
    of 0 is the same as a line width of 1. The cap and join style have
    no effect on 0-width lines.

    The pen color defines the color of lines and text. The default
    line color is black. The QColor documentation lists predefined
    colors.

    The cap style defines how the end points of lines are drawn. The
    join style defines how the joins between two lines are drawn when
    multiple connected lines are drawn (QPainter::drawPolyline()
    etc.). The cap and join styles only apply to wide lines, i.e. when
    the width is 1 or greater.

    Use the QBrush class to specify fill styles.

    Example:
    \code
    QPainter painter;
    QPen     pen( red, 2 );             // red solid line, 2 pixels wide
    painter.begin( &anyPaintDevice );   // paint something
    painter.setPen( pen );              // set the red, wide pen
    painter.drawRect( 40,30, 200,100 ); // draw a rectangle
    painter.setPen( blue );             // set blue pen, 0 pixel width
    painter.drawLine( 40,30, 240,130 ); // draw a diagonal in rectangle
    painter.end();                      // painting done
    \endcode

    See the \l Qt::PenStyle enum type for a complete list of pen
    styles.

    With reference to the end points of lines, for wide (non-0-width)
    pens it depends on the cap style whether the end point is drawn or
    not. QPainter will try to make sure that the end point is drawn
    for 0-width pens, but this cannot be absolutely guaranteed because
    the underlying drawing engine is free to use any (typically
    accelerated) algorithm for drawing 0-width lines. On all tested
    systems, however, the end point of at least all non-diagonal lines
    are drawn.

    A pen's color(), width(), style(), capStyle() and joinStyle() can
    be set in the constructor or later with setColor(), setWidth(),
    setStyle(), setCapStyle() and setJoinStyle(). Pens may also be
    compared and streamed.

    \brief The QBrush class defines the fill pattern of shapes drawn by a QPainter.

    \ingroup graphics
    \ingroup images
    \ingroup shared

    A brush has a style and a color. One of the brush styles is a
    custom pattern, which is defined by a QPixmap.

    The brush style defines the fill pattern. The default brush style
    is \c NoBrush (depending on how you construct a brush). This style
    tells the painter to not fill shapes. The standard style for
    filling is \c SolidPattern.

    The brush color defines the color of the fill pattern. The QColor
    documentation lists the predefined colors.

    Use the QPen class for specifying line/outline styles.

    Example:
    \code
        QPainter painter;
        QBrush   brush( yellow );           // yellow solid pattern
        painter.begin( &anyPaintDevice );   // paint something
        painter.setBrush( brush );          // set the yellow brush
        painter.setPen( NoPen );            // do not draw outline
        painter.drawRect( 40,30, 200,100 ); // draw filled rectangle
        painter.setBrush( NoBrush );        // do not fill
        painter.setPen( black );            // set black pen, 0 pixel width
        painter.drawRect( 10,10, 30,20 );   // draw rectangle outline
