    \class QEventLoop
    \brief The QEventLoop class manages the event queue.

    \ingroup application
    \ingroup events

    It receives events from the window system and other sources.  It
    then sends them to QApplication for processing and delivery.

    QEventLoop allows the application programmer to have more control
    over event delivery.  Programs that perform long operations can
    call either processOneEvent() or processEvents() with various
    ProcessEvent values OR'ed together to control which events should
    be delivered.

    QEventLoop also allows the integration of an external event loop
    with the Qt event loop.  The Motif Extension included with Qt
    includes a reimplementation of QEventLoop for merging Qt and Motif
    events together.

    To use your own instance of QEventLoop or QEventLoop subclass create 
    it before you create the QApplication object.
*/

/*! \enum QEventLoop::ProcessEvents

    This enum controls the types of events processed by the
    processEvents() functions.

    \value AllEvents - All events are processed
    \value ExcludeUserInput - Do not process user input events.
           ( ButtonPress, KeyPress, etc. )
    \value ExcludeSocketNotifiers - Do not process socket notifier
           events.
    \value WaitForMore - Wait for events if no pending events
           are available.

    Enters the main event loop and waits until exit() is called, and
    returns the value that was set to exit().

    It is necessary to call this function to start event handling. The
    main event loop receives events from the window system and
    dispatches these to the application widgets.

    Generally speaking, no user interaction can take place before
    calling exec(). As a special case, modal widgets like QMessageBox
    can be used before calling exec(), because modal widgets call
    exec() to start a local event loop.

    To make your application perform idle processing, i.e. executing a
    special function whenever there are no pending events, use a
    QTimer with 0 timeout. More advanced idle processing schemes can
    be achieved using processEvents().

    By convention, a \a retcode of 0 means success, and any non-zero
    value indicates an error.

    operation and want to show its progress without allowing user

    are available and return after processing newly available events.

    events are available, this function will return immediately.

    timers or -1 if there are no timers running.

    QEventLoop subclasses that do their own timer handling need to use
    this to make sure that Qt's timers continue to work.

    Note: This function is only useful on systems where \c select() is
    used to block the eventloop.  On Windows, this function always
    returns -1.  On MacOS X, this function always returns -1 when the
