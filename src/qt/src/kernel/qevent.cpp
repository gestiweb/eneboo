    \class QEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QEvent class is the base class of all
    event classes. Event objects contain event parameters.

    \ingroup events
    \ingroup environment

    Qt's main event loop (QApplication::exec()) fetches native window
    system events from the event queue, translates them into QEvents
    and sends the translated events to QObjects.

    In general, events come from the underlying window system
    (spontaneous() returns TRUE) but it is also possible to manually
    send events using QApplication::sendEvent() and
    QApplication::postEvent() (spontaneous() returns FALSE).

    QObjects receive events by having their QObject::event() function
    called. The function can be reimplemented in subclasses to
    customize event handling and add additional event types;
    QWidget::event() is a notable example. By default, events are
    dispatched to event handlers like QObject::timerEvent() and
    QWidget::mouseMoveEvent(). QObject::installEventFilter() allows an
    object to intercept events destined for another object.

    The basic QEvent contains only an event type parameter.
    Subclasses of QEvent contain additional parameters that describe
    the particular event.

    \ingroup events

    Timer events are sent at regular intervals to objects that have
    started one or more timers. Each timer has a unique identifier. A
    timer is started with QObject::startTimer().

    The QTimer class provides a high-level programming interface that
    uses signals instead of events. It also provides one-shot timers.

    The event handler QObject::timerEvent() receives timer events.

    Returns the unique timer identifier, which is the same identifier
    as returned from QObject::startTimer().
*/


/*!
    \class QMouseEvent qevent.h
    \ingroup events

    \brief The QMouseEvent class contains parameters that describe a mouse event.

    Mouse events occur when a mouse button is pressed or released
    inside a widget or when the mouse cursor is moved.

    Mouse move events will occur only when a mouse button is pressed
    down, unless mouse tracking has been enabled with
    QWidget::setMouseTracking().

    Qt automatically grabs the mouse when a mouse button is pressed
    inside a widget; the widget will continue to receive mouse events
    until the last mouse button is released.

    A mouse event contains a special accept flag that indicates
    whether the receiver wants the event. You should call
    QMouseEvent::ignore() if the mouse event is not handled by your
    widget. A mouse event is propagated up the parent widget chain
    until a widget accepts it with QMouseEvent::accept() or an event
    filter consumes it.

    The functions pos(), x() and y() give the cursor position relative
    to the widget that receives the mouse event. If you move the
    widget as a result of the mouse event, use the global position
    returned by globalPos() to avoid a shaking motion.

    The QWidget::setEnabled() function can be used to enable or
    disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    The event handlers QWidget::mousePressEvent(),
    QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent(), QWidget::mouseDoubleClickEvent() and
    QWidget::mouseMoveEvent() receive mouse events.

    \sa QWidget::setMouseTracking(), QWidget::grabMouse(),
    QCursor::pos()
*/

/*!
    \fn QMouseEvent::QMouseEvent( Type type, const QPoint &pos, int button, int state )

    Constructs a mouse event object.

    The \a type parameter must be one of \c QEvent::MouseButtonPress,
    \c QEvent::MouseButtonRelease, \c QEvent::MouseButtonDblClick or
    \c QEvent::MouseMove.

    The \a pos parameter specifies the position relative to the
    receiving widget. \a button specifies the \link Qt::ButtonState
    button\endlink that caused the event, which should be \c
    Qt::NoButton (0), if \a type is \c MouseMove. \a state is the
    \link Qt::ButtonState ButtonState\endlink at the time of the
    event.

    The globalPos() is initialized to QCursor::pos(), which may not be
    appropriate. Use the other constructor to specify the global
    position explicitly.

    The \a type parameter must be \c QEvent::MouseButtonPress, \c
    QEvent::MouseButtonRelease, \c QEvent::MouseButtonDblClick or \c
    QEvent::MouseMove.

    The \a pos parameter specifies the position relative to the
    receiving widget. \a globalPos is the position in absolute
    coordinates. \a button specifies the \link Qt::ButtonState
    button\endlink that caused the event, which should be \c
    Qt::NoButton (0), if \a type is \c MouseMove. \a state is the
    \link Qt::ButtonState ButtonState\endlink at the time of the

    events.

    This means that if you have a \c QEvent::MouseButtonPress or a \c
    QEvent::MouseButtonDblClick state() will \e not include the mouse
    button that's pressed. But once the mouse button has been
    released, the \c QEvent::MouseButtonRelease event will have the
    button() that was pressed.

    This value is mainly interesting for \c QEvent::MouseMove; for the
    other cases, button() is more useful.

    \ingroup events

    Paint events are sent to widgets that need to update themselves,
    for instance when part of a widget is exposed because a covering
    widget is moved.

    The event contains a region() that needs to be updated, and a
    rect() that is the bounding rectangle of that region. Both are
    provided because many widgets can't make much use of region(), and
    rect() can be much faster than region().boundingRect(). Painting
    is clipped to region() during processing of a paint event.

    The erased() function returns TRUE if the region() has been
    cleared to the widget's background (see
    QWidget::backgroundMode()), and FALSE if the region's contents are
    arbitrary.

/*!
    \class QCloseEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QCloseEvent class contains parameters that describe a close event.

    \ingroup events

    Close events are sent to widgets that the user wants to close,
    usually by choosing "Close" from the window menu, or by clicking
    the `X' titlebar button. They are also sent when you call
    QWidget::close() to close a widget programmatically.

    Close events contain a flag that indicates whether the receiver
    wants the widget to be closed or not. When a widget accepts the
    close event, it is hidden (and destroyed if it was created with
    the \c WDestructiveClose flag). If it refuses to accept the close
    event nothing happens. (Under X11 it is possible that the window
    manager will forcibly close the window; but at the time of writing
    we are not aware of any window manager that does this.)

    The application's main widget -- QApplication::mainWidget() --
    is a special case. When it accepts the close event, Qt leaves the
    main event loop and the application is immediately terminated
    (i.e. it returns from the call to QApplication::exec() in the
    main() function).

    The event handler QWidget::closeEvent() receives close events. The
    default implementation of this event handler accepts the close
    event. If you do not want your widget to be hidden, or want some
    special handing, you should reimplement the event handler.

    The \link simple-application.html#closeEvent closeEvent() in the
    Application Walkthrough\endlink shows a close event handler that
    asks whether to save a document before closing.

    If you want the widget to be deleted when it is closed, create it
    with the \c WDestructiveClose widget flag. This is very useful for
    independent top-level windows in a multi-window application.

    \l{QObject}s emits the \link QObject::destroyed()
    destroyed()\endlink signal when they are deleted.

    If the last top-level window is closed, the
    QApplication::lastWindowClosed() signal is emitted.

    The isAccepted() function returns TRUE if the event's receiver has
    agreed to close the widget; call accept() to agree to close the
    widget and call ignore() if the receiver of this event does not
    want the widget to be closed.

    \brief The QContextMenuEvent class contains parameters that describe a context menu event.

    \ingroup events

    Context menu events are sent to widgets when a user triggers a
    context menu. What triggers this is platform dependent. For
    example, on Windows, pressing the menu button or releasing the
    right mouse button will cause this event to be sent.

    When this event occurs it is customary to show a QPopupMenu with a
    context menu, if this is relevant to the context.

    Context menu events contain a special accept flag that indicates
    whether the receiver accepted the event. If the event handler does
    not accept the event, then whatever triggered the event will be
    handled as a regular input event if possible.

    \class QIMEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QIMEvent class provides parameters for input method events.

    \ingroup events

    Input method events are sent to widgets when an input method is
    used to enter text into a widget. Input methods are widely used to
    enter text in Asian and other complex languages.

    The events are of interest to widgets that accept keyboard input
    and want to be able to correctly handle complex languages. Text
    input in such languages is usually a three step process.

    \list 1
    \i <b>Starting to Compose</b><br>
    When the user presses the first key on a keyboard an input context
    is created. This input context will contain a string with the
    typed characters.

    \i <b>Composing</b><br>
    With every new key pressed, the input method will try to create a
    matching string for the text typed so far. While the input context
    is active, the user can only move the cursor inside the string
    belonging to this input context.

    \i <b>Completing</b><br>
    At some point, e.g. when the user presses the Spacebar, they get
    to this stage, where they can choose from a number of strings that
    match the text they have typed so far. The user can press Enter to
    confirm their choice or Escape to cancel the input; in either case
    the input context will be closed.
    \endlist

    Note that the particular key presses used for a given input
    context may differ from those we've mentioned here, i.e. they may
    not be Spacebar, Enter and Escape.

    These three stages are represented by three different types of
    events. The IMStartEvent, IMComposeEvent and IMEndEvent. When a
    new input context is created, an IMStartEvent will be sent to the
    widget and delivered to the \l QWidget::imStartEvent() function.
    The widget can then update internal data structures to reflect
    this.

    After this, an IMComposeEvent will be sent to the widget for
    every key the user presses. It will contain the current
    composition string the widget has to show and the current cursor
    position within the composition string. This string is temporary
    and can change with every key the user types, so the widget will
    need to store the state before the composition started (the state
    it had when it received the IMStartEvent). IMComposeEvents will be
    delivered to the \l QWidget::imComposeEvent() function.

    Usually, widgets try to mark the part of the text that is part of
    the current composition in a way that is visible to the user. A
    commonly used visual cue is to use a dotted underline.

    After the user has selected the final string, an IMEndEvent will
    be sent to the widget. The event contains the final string the
    user selected, and could be empty if they canceled the
    composition. This string should be accepted as the final text the
    user entered, and the intermediate composition string should be
    cleared. These events are delivered to \l QWidget::imEndEvent().

    If the user clicks another widget, taking the focus out of the
    widget where the composition is taking place the IMEndEvent will
    be sent and the string it holds will be the result of the
    composition up to that point (which may be an empty string).
*/

/*!
    \fn  QIMEvent::QIMEvent( Type type, const QString &text, int cursorPosition )

    Constructs a new QIMEvent with the accept flag set to FALSE. \a
    type can be one of QEvent::IMStartEvent, QEvent::IMComposeEvent

    string and \a cursorPosition the current position of the cursor
    inside \a text.
*/

/*!
    \fn const QString &QIMEvent::text() const

    Returns the composition text. This is a null string for an
    IMStartEvent, and contains the final accepted string (which may be
    empty) in the IMEndEvent.

    \class QTabletEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QTabletEvent class contains parameters that describe a Tablet
    event.

    \ingroup events

    Tablet Events are generated from a Wacom&copy; tablet. Most of
    the time you will want to deal with events from the tablet as if
    they were events from a mouse, for example retrieving the position
    with x(), y(), pos(), globalX(), globalY() and globalPos(). In
    some situations you may wish to retrieve the extra information
    provided by the tablet device driver, for example, you might want
    to adjust color brightness based on pressure. QTabletEvent allows
    you to get the pressure(), the xTilt() and yTilt(), as well as the
    type of device being used with device() (see \l{TabletDevice}).

    A tablet event contains a special accept flag that indicates
    whether the receiver wants the event. You should call
    QTabletEvent::accept() if you handle the tablet event; otherwise
    it will be sent to the parent widget.

    The QWidget::setEnabled() function can be used to enable or
    disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

  The event handler QWidget::tabletEvent() receives all three types of tablet
  events.  Qt will first send a tabletEvent and then, if it is not accepted,
  it will send a mouse event.  This allows applications that don't utilize
  tablets to use a tablet like a mouse while also enabling those who want to
  use both tablets and mouses differently.

/*!
    \class QCustomEvent qevent.h
    \brief The QCustomEvent class provides support for custom events.

    \ingroup events

    QCustomEvent is a generic event class for user-defined events.
    User defined events can be sent to widgets or other QObject
    instances using QApplication::postEvent() or
    QApplication::sendEvent(). Subclasses of QObject can easily
    receive custom events by implementing the QObject::customEvent()
    event handler function.

    QCustomEvent objects should be created with a type ID that
    uniquely identifies the event type. To avoid clashes with the
    Qt-defined events types, the value should be at least as large as
    the value of the "User" entry in the QEvent::Type enum.

    QCustomEvent contains a generic void* data member that may be used
    for transferring event-specific data to the receiver. Note that
    since events are normally delivered asynchronously, the data
    pointer, if used, must remain valid until the event has been
    received and processed.

    QCustomEvent can be used as-is for simple user-defined event
    types, but normally you will want to make a subclass of it for
    your event types. In a subclass, you can add data members that are
    suitable for your event type.

    Example:
    \code
    class ColorChangeEvent : public QCustomEvent
    {
    public:
	ColorChangeEvent( QColor color )
	    : QCustomEvent( 65432 ), c( color ) {}
	QColor color() const { return c; }
    private:
	QColor c;
    };

    // To send an event of this custom event type:

    ColorChangeEvent* ce = new ColorChangeEvent( blue );
    QApplication::postEvent( receiver, ce );  // Qt will delete it when done

    // To receive an event of this custom event type:

    void MyWidget::customEvent( QCustomEvent * e )
    {
	if ( e->type() == 65432 ) {  // It must be a ColorChangeEvent
	    ColorChangeEvent* ce = (ColorChangeEvent*)e;
	    newColor = ce->color();
	}
    }

    controls, either by iconifying the window or by switching to
    another virtual desktop where the window isn't visible. The window
    will become hidden but not withdrawn. If the window was iconified,
    QWidget::isMinimized() returns TRUE.

    \brief The QShowEvent class provides an event which is sent when a widget is shown.

    \ingroup events

    There are two kinds of show events: show events caused by the
    window system (spontaneous) and internal show events. Spontaneous
    show events are sent just after the window system shows the
    window, including after a top-level window has been shown
    (un-iconified) by the user. Internal show events are delivered
    just before the widget becomes visible.
