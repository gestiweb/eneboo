    \class QThread qthread.h
    \threadsafe
    \brief The QThread class provides platform-independent threads.

    \ingroup thread
    \ingroup environment

    A QThread represents a separate thread of control within the
    program; it shares data with all the other threads within the
    process but executes independently in the way that a separate
    program does on a multitasking operating system. Instead of
    starting in main(), QThreads begin executing in run(). You inherit
    run() to include your code. For example:

    \code
    class MyThread : public QThread {

    public:

	virtual void run();

    };

    void MyThread::run()
    {
	for( int count = 0; count < 20; count++ ) {
	    sleep( 1 );
	    qDebug( "Ping!" );
	}
    }

    int main()
    {
	MyThread a;
	MyThread b;
	a.start();
	b.start();
	a.wait();
	b.wait();
    }
    \endcode

    This will start two threads, each of which writes Ping! 20 times
    to the screen and exits. The wait() calls at the end of main() are
    necessary because exiting main() ends the program, unceremoniously
    killing all other threads. Each MyThread stops executing when it
    reaches the end of MyThread::run(), just as an application does
    when it leaves main().

/*!
    \enum QThread::Priority

    This enum type indicates how the operating system should schedule
    newly created threads.

    \value IdlePriority scheduled only when no other threads are
           running.

    \value LowestPriority scheduled less often than LowPriority.
    \value LowPriority scheduled less often than NormalPriority.

    \value NormalPriority the default priority of the operating
           system.

    \value HighPriority scheduled more often than NormalPriority.
    \value HighestPriority scheduled more often then HighPriority.

    \value TimeCriticalPriority scheduled as often as possible.

    \value InheritPriority use the same priority as the creating
           thread.  This is the default.
