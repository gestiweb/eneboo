    \class QUrlOperator qurloperator.h

    \brief The QUrlOperator class provides common operations on URLs.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">Qt Enterprise Edition</a>.
\endif

    \ingroup io
    \ingroup misc
    \mainclass

    \module network

    This class operates on hierarchical structures (such as
    filesystems) using URLs. Its API facilitates all the common
    operations:
    \table
    \header \i Operation	\i Function
    \row \i List files		\i \l listChildren()
    \row \i Make a directory	\i \l mkdir()
    \row \i Remove a file	\i \l remove()
    \row \i Rename a file	\i \l rename()
    \row \i Get a file		\i \l get()
    \row \i Put a file		\i \l put()
    \row \i Copy a file		\i \l copy()
    \endtable

    You can obtain additional information about the URL with isDir()
    and info(). If a directory is to be traversed using
    listChildren(), a name filter can be set with setNameFilter().

    A QUrlOperator can be used like this, for example to download a
    file (and assuming that the FTP protocol is \link
    qInitNetworkProtocols() registered\endlink):
    \code
    QUrlOperator *op = new QUrlOperator();
    op->copy( QString("ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-2.1.0.tar.gz"),
	     "file:/tmp" );
    \endcode

    If you want to be notified about success/failure, progress, etc.,
    you can connect to QUrlOperator's signals, e.g. to start(),
    newChildren(), createdDirectory(), removed(), data(),
    dataTransferProgress(), startedNextCopy(),
    connectionStateChanged(), finished(), etc. A network operation can
    be stopped with stop().

    The class uses the functionality of registered network protocols
    to perform these operations. Depending of the protocol of the URL,
    it uses an appropriate network protocol class for the operations.
    Each of the operation functions of QUrlOperator creates a
    QNetworkOperation object that describes the operation and puts it
    into the operation queue for the network protocol used. If no
    suitable protocol could be found (because no implementation of the
    necessary network protocol is registered), the URL operator emits
    errors. Not every protocol supports every operation, but error
    handling deals with this problem.

    To register the available network protocols, use the
    qInitNetworkProtocols() function. The protocols currently
    supported are:
    \list
    \i \link QFtp FTP\endlink,
    \i \link QHttp HTTP\endlink,
    \i \link QLocalFs local file system\endlink.
    \endlist

    For more information about the Qt Network Architecture see the
    \link network.html Qt Network Documentation\endlink.

    This signal is emitted after listChildren() was called and new
    children (i.e. files) have been read from a list of files. \a i
    holds the information about the new files. \a op is a pointer
    to the operation object which contains all the information about
    the operation, including the state.

    \sa QNetworkOperation, QNetworkProtocol
*/


/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::finished( QNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when an operation of some sort finishes,
    whether with success or failure. \a op is a pointer to the
    operation object, which contains all the information, including
    the state, of the operation which has been finished. Check the
    state and error code of the operation object to see whether or not
    the operation was successful.

    \sa QNetworkOperation, QNetworkProtocol
*/

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::start( QNetworkOperation *op )

    Some operations (such as listChildren()) emit this signal when
    they start processing the operation. \a op is a pointer to the
    operation object which contains all the information about the
    operation, including the state.

    \sa QNetworkOperation, QNetworkProtocol
*/

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::createdDirectory( const QUrlInfo &i, QNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when mkdir() succeeds and the directory has
    been created. \a i holds the information about the new directory.

    \a op is a pointer to the operation object, which contains all the
    information about the operation, including the state.
    \c op->arg(0) holds the new directory's name.

    \sa QNetworkOperation, QNetworkProtocol
*/

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::removed( QNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when remove() has been succesful and the
    file has been removed.

    \a op is a pointer to the operation object which contains all the
    information about the operation, including the state.
    \c op->arg(0) holds the name of the file that was removed.

    \sa QNetworkOperation, QNetworkProtocol
*/

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::itemChanged( QNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted whenever a file which is a child of the URL
    has been changed, for example by successfully calling rename().
    \a op is a pointer to the operation object which contains all the
    information about the operation, including the state.
    \c op->arg(0) holds the original file name and \c op->arg(1) holds
    the new file name (if it was changed).

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::data( const QByteArray &data, QNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted when new \a data has been received after calling
    get() or put().
    \a op is a pointer to the operation object which contains all
    the information about the operation, including the state.
    \c op->arg(0) holds the name of the file whose data is retrieved
    and op->rawArg(1) holds the (raw) data.

*/

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::dataTransferProgress( int bytesDone, int bytesTotal, QNetworkOperation *op )

    This signal is emitted during data transfer (using put() or
    get()). \a bytesDone specifies how many bytes of \a bytesTotal have
    been transferred. More information about the operation is stored in
    \a op, a pointer to the network operation that is processed.
    \a bytesTotal may be -1, which means that the total number of bytes
    is not known.

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::startedNextCopy( const QPtrList<QNetworkOperation> &lst )

*/

/*!
    \fn void QUrlOperator::connectionStateChanged( int state, const QString &data )

    This signal is emitted whenever the URL operator's connection
    state changes. \a state describes the new state, which is a
    \l{QNetworkProtocol::ConnectionState} value.

    \a data is a string that describes the change of the connection.
    This can be used to display a message to the user.

/*!
    Tells the network protocol to get data from \a location or, if
    this is QString::null, to get data from the location to which this
    URL points (see QUrl::fileName() and QUrl::encodedPathAndQuery()).
    What happens then depends on the network protocol. The data()
    signal is emitted when data comes in. Because it's unlikely that
    all data will come in at once, it is common for multiple data()
    signals to be emitted. The dataTransferProgress() signal is
    emitted while processing the operation. At the end, finished()
    (with success or failure) is emitted, so check the state of the
    network operation object to see whether or not the operation was
    successful.

    If \a location is QString::null, the path of this QUrlOperator
    should point to a file when you use this operation. If \a location
    is not empty, it can be a relative URL (a child of the path to
    which the QUrlOperator points) or an absolute URL.

    For example, to get a web page you might do something like this:

    \code
    QUrlOperator op( "http://www.whatever.org/cgi-bin/search.pl?cmd=Hello" );
    op.get();
    \endcode

    For most other operations, the path of the QUrlOperator must point
    to a directory. If you want to download a file you could do the
    following:

    \code
    QUrlOperator op( "ftp://ftp.whatever.org/pub" );
    // do some other stuff like op.listChildren() or op.mkdir( "new_dir" )
    op.get( "a_file.txt" );
    \endcode

    This will get the data of ftp://ftp.whatever.org/pub/a_file.txt.

    \e Never do anything like this:
    \code
    QUrlOperator op( "http://www.whatever.org/cgi-bin" );
    op.get( "search.pl?cmd=Hello" ); // WRONG!
    \endcode

    If \a location is not empty and relative it must not contain any
    queries or references, just the name of a child. So if you need to
    specify a query or reference, do it as shown in the first example
    or specify the full URL (such as
    http://www.whatever.org/cgi-bin/search.pl?cmd=Hello) as \a location.

    This function tells the network protocol to put \a data in \a
    location. If \a location is empty (QString::null), it puts the \a
    data in the location to which the URL points. What happens depends
    on the network protocol. Depending on the network protocol, some
    data might come back after putting data, in which case the data()
    signal is emitted. The dataTransferProgress() signal is emitted
    during processing of the operation. At the end, finished() (with
    success or failure) is emitted, so check the state of the network

    For putting some data to a file you can do the following:

    \code
    QUrlOperator op( "ftp://ftp.whatever.com/home/me/filename.dat" );
    op.put( data );
    \endcode

    For most other operations, the path of the QUrlOperator must point
