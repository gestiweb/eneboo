    \class QFocusData qfocusdata.h
    \brief The QFocusData class maintains the list of widgets in the focus
    chain.

    \ingroup misc

    This read-only list always contains at least one widget (i.e. the
    top-level widget). It provides a simple cursor which can be reset
    to the current focus widget using home(), or moved to its
    neighboring widgets using next() and prev(). You can also retrieve
    the count() of the number of widgets in the list. The list is a
    loop, so if you keep iterating, for example using next(), you will
    never come to the end.

    Some widgets in the list may not accept focus. Widgets are added
    to the list as necessary, but not removed from it. This lets
    widgets change focus policy dynamically without disrupting the
    focus chain the user experiences. When a widget disables and
    re-enables tab focus, its position in the focus chain does not
    change.

    When reimplementing QWidget::focusNextPrevChild() to provide
    special focus flow, you will usually call QWidget::focusData() to
    retrieve the focus data stored at the top-level widget. A
    top-level widget's focus data contains the focus list for its
    hierarchy of widgets.

    The cursor may change at any time.

    This class is \e not thread-safe.
