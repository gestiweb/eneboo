    \class QSound qsound.h
    \brief The QSound class provides access to the platform audio facilities.

    \ingroup multimedia
    \mainclass

    Qt provides the most commonly required audio operation in GUI
    applications: asynchronously playing a sound file. This is most
    easily accomplished with a single call:
    \code
	QSound::play("mysounds/bells.wav");
    \endcode

    A second API is provided in which a QSound object is created from
    a sound file and is played later:
    \code
	QSound bells("mysounds/bells.wav");

	bells.play();
    \endcode

    Sounds played using the second model may use more memory but play
    more immediately than sounds played using the first model,
    depending on the underlying platform audio facilities.

    On Microsoft Windows the underlying multimedia system is used;
    only WAVE format sound files are supported.

    On X11 the \link ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/nas/ Network Audio
    System\endlink is used if available, otherwise all operations work
    silently. NAS supports WAVE and AU files.

    On Macintosh, ironically, we use QT (\link
    http://quicktime.apple.com QuickTime\endlink) for sound, this
    means all QuickTime formats are supported by Qt/Mac.

    On Qt/Embedded, a built-in mixing sound server is used, which
    accesses \c /dev/dsp directly. Only the WAVE format is supported.

    The availability of sound can be tested with
    QSound::isAvailable().
