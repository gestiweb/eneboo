/*
 * The functions in this file implement the Region abstraction, similar to one
 * used in the X11 sample server. A Region is simply an area, as the name
 * implies, and is implemented as a "y-x-banded" array of rectangles. To
 * explain: Each Region is made up of a certain number of rectangles sorted
 * by y coordinate first, and then by x coordinate.
 *
 * Furthermore, the rectangles are banded such that every rectangle with a
 * given upper-left y coordinate (y1) will have the same lower-right y
 * coordinate (y2) and vice versa. If a rectangle has scanlines in a band, it
 * will span the entire vertical distance of the band. This means that some
 * areas that could be merged into a taller rectangle will be represented as
 * several shorter rectangles to account for shorter rectangles to its left
 * or right but within its "vertical scope".
 *
 * An added constraint on the rectangles is that they must cover as much
 * horizontal area as possible. E.g. no two rectangles in a band are allowed
 * to touch.
 *
 * Whenever possible, bands will be merged together to cover a greater vertical
 * distance (and thus reduce the number of rectangles). Two bands can be merged
 * only if the bottom of one touches the top of the other and they have
 * rectangles in the same places (of the same width, of course). This maintains
 * the y-x-banding that's so nice to have...

/*
 *  In scan converting polygons, we want to choose those pixels
 *  which are inside the polygon.  Thus, we add .5 to the starting
 *  x coordinate for both left and right edges.  Now we choose the
 *  first pixel which is inside the pgon for the left edge and the
 *  first pixel which is outside the pgon for the right edge.
 *  Draw the left pixel, but not the right.
 *
 *  How to add .5 to the starting x coordinate:
 *      If the edge is moving to the right, then subtract dy from the
 *  error term from the general form of the algorithm.
 *      If the edge is moving to the left, then add dy to the error term.
 *
 *  The reason for the difference between edges moving to the left
 *  and edges moving to the right is simple:  If an edge is moving
 *  to the right, then we want the algorithm to flip immediately.
 *  If it is moving to the left, then we don't want it to flip until
 *  we traverse an entire pixel.

/*
 *     These are the data structures needed to scan
 *     convert regions.  Two different scan conversion
 *     methods are available -- the even-odd method, and
 *     the winding number method.
 *     The even-odd rule states that a point is inside
 *     the polygon if a ray drawn from that point in any
 *     direction will pass through an odd number of
 *     path segments.
 *     By the winding number rule, a point is decided
 *     to be inside the polygon if a ray drawn from that
 *     point in any direction passes through a different
 *     number of clockwise and counter-clockwise path
 *     segments.
 *
 *     These data structures are adapted somewhat from
 *     the algorithm in (Foley/Van Dam) for scan converting
 *     polygons.
 *     The basic algorithm is to start at the top (smallest y)
 *     of the polygon, stepping down to the bottom of
 *     the polygon by incrementing the y coordinate.  We
 *     keep a list of edges which the current scanline crosses,
 *     sorted by x.  This list is called the Active Edge Table (AET)
 *     As we change the y-coordinate, we update each entry in
 *     in the active edge table to reflect the edges new xcoord.
 *     This list must be sorted at each scanline in case
 *     two edges intersect.
 *     We also keep a data structure known as the Edge Table (ET),
 *     which keeps track of all the edges which the current
 *     scanline has not yet reached.  The ET is basically a
 *     list of ScanLineList structures containing a list of
 *     edges which are entered at a given scanline.  There is one
 *     ScanLineList per scanline at which an edge is entered.
 *     When we enter a new edge, we move it from the ET to the AET.
 *
 *     From the AET, we can implement the even-odd rule as in
 *     (Foley/Van Dam).
 *     The winding number rule is a little trickier.  We also
 *     keep the EdgeTableEntries in the AET linked by the
 *     nextWETE (winding EdgeTableEntry) link.  This allows
 *     the edges to be linked just as before for updating
 *     purposes, but only uses the edges linked by the nextWETE
 *     link as edges representing spans of the polygon to
 *     drawn (as with the even-odd rule).
