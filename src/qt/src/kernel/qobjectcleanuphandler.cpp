    \class QObjectCleanupHandler qobjectcleanuphandler.h
    \brief The QObjectCleanupHandler class watches the lifetime of multiple QObjects.

    \ingroup objectmodel

    A QObjectCleanupHandler is useful whenever you need to know when a
    number of \l{QObject}s that are owned by someone else have been
    deleted. This is important, for example, when referencing memory
    in an application that has been allocated in a shared library.

    Example:

    \code
    class FactoryComponent : public FactoryInterface, public QLibraryInterface
    {
    public:
	...

	QObject *createObject();

	bool init();
	void cleanup();
	bool canUnload() const;

    private:
	QObjectCleanupHandler objects;
    };

    // allocate a new object, and add it to the cleanup handler
    QObject *FactoryComponent::createObject()
    {
	return objects.add( new QObject() );
    }

    // QLibraryInterface implementation
    bool FactoryComponent::init()
    {
	return TRUE;
    }

    void FactoryComponent::cleanup()
    {
    }

    // it is only safe to unload the library when all QObject's have been destroyed
    bool FactoryComponent::canUnload() const
    {
	return objects.isEmpty();
    }
    \endcode

    will be deleted.

    }
    connect( object, SIGNAL(destroyed(QObject*)), this, SLOT(objectDestroyed(QObject*)) );
    cleanupObjects->insert( 0, object );
    return object;
}
