    \class QMessageBox
    \brief The QMessageBox class provides a modal dialog with a short message, an icon, and some buttons.
    \ingroup dialogs
    \mainclass

    Message boxes are used to provide informative messages and to ask
    simple questions.

    QMessageBox provides a range of different messages, arranged
    roughly along two axes: severity and complexity.

    Severity is
    \table
    \row
    \i \img qmessagebox-quest.png
    \i Question
    \i For message boxes that ask a question as part of normal
    operation. Some style guides recommend using Information for this
    purpose.
    \row
    \i \img qmessagebox-info.png
    \i Information
    \i For message boxes that are part of normal operation.
    \row
    \i \img qmessagebox-warn.png
    \i Warning
    \i For message boxes that tell the user about unusual errors.
    \row
    \i \img qmessagebox-crit.png
    \i Critical
    \i For message boxes that tell the user about critical errors.
    \endtable

    The message box has a different icon for each of the severity levels.

    Complexity is one button (OK) for simple messages, or two or even
    three buttons for questions.

    There are static functions for the most common cases.

    Examples:

    If a program is unable to find a supporting file, but can do perfectly
    well without it:

    \code
    QMessageBox::information( this, "Application name",
    "Unable to find the user preferences file.\n"
    "The factory default will be used instead." );
    \endcode

    question() is useful for simple yes/no questions:

    \code
    if ( QFile::exists( filename ) &&
	QMessageBox::question(
	    this,
	    tr("Overwrite File? -- Application Name"),
	    tr("A file called %1 already exists."
		"Do you want to overwrite it?")
		.arg( filename ),
	    tr("&Yes"), tr("&No"),
	    QString::null, 0, 1 ) )
	return false;
    \endcode

    warning() can be used to tell the user about unusual errors, or
    errors which can't be easily fixed:

    \code
    switch( QMessageBox::warning( this, "Application name",
        "Could not connect to the <mumble> server.\n"
        "This program can't function correctly "
        "without the server.\n\n",
        "Retry",
        "Quit", 0, 0, 1 ) ) {
    case 0: // The user clicked the Retry again button or pressed Enter
	// try again
	break;
    case 1: // The user clicked the Quit or pressed Escape
	// exit
	break;
    }
    \endcode

    The text part of all message box messages can be either rich text
    or plain text. If you specify a rich text formatted string, it
    will be rendered using the default stylesheet. See
    QStyleSheet::defaultSheet() for details. With certain strings that
    contain XML meta characters, the auto-rich text detection may
    fail, interpreting plain text incorrectly as rich text. In these
    rare cases, use QStyleSheet::convertFromPlainText() to convert
    your plain text string to a visually equivalent rich text string
    or set the text format explicitly with setTextFormat().

    Note that the Microsoft Windows User Interface Guidelines
    recommend using the application name as the window's caption.

    Below are more examples of how to use the static member functions.
    After these examples you will find an overview of the non-static
    member functions.

    Exiting a program is part of its normal operation. If there is
    unsaved data the user probably should be asked if they want to
    save the data. For example:

    \code
    switch( QMessageBox::information( this, "Application name here",
	"The document contains unsaved changes\n"
	"Do you want to save the changes before exiting?",
	"&Save", "&Discard", "Cancel",
	0,      // Enter == button 0
	2 ) ) { // Escape == button 2
    case 0: // Save clicked or Alt+S pressed or Enter pressed.
	// save
	break;
    case 1: // Discard clicked or Alt+D pressed
	// don't save but exit
	break;
    case 2: // Cancel clicked or Escape pressed
	// don't exit
	break;
    }
    \endcode

    The Escape button cancels the entire exit operation, and pressing
    Enter causes the changes to be saved before the exit occurs.

    Disk full errors are unusual and they certainly can be hard to
    correct. This example uses predefined buttons instead of
    hard-coded button texts:

    \code
    switch( QMessageBox::warning( this, "Application name here",
	"Could not save the user preferences,\n"
	"because the disk is full. You can delete\n"
	"some files and press Retry, or you can\n"
	"abort the Save Preferences operation.",
	QMessageBox::Retry | QMessageBox::Default,
	QMessageBox::Abort | QMessageBox::Escape )) {
    case QMessageBox::Retry: // Retry clicked or Enter pressed
	// try again
	break;
    case QMessageBox::Abort: // Abort clicked or Escape pressed
	// abort
	break;
    }
    \endcode

    The critical() function should be reserved for critical errors. In
    this example errorDetails is a QString or const char*, and QString
    is used to concatenate several strings:

    \code
    QMessageBox::critical( 0, "Application name here",
	QString("An internal error occurred. Please ") +
	"call technical support at 1234-56789 and report\n"+
	"these numbers:\n\n" + errorDetails +
	"\n\nApplication will now exit." );
    \endcode

    In this example an OK button is displayed.

    QMessageBox provides a very simple About box which displays an
    appropriate icon and the string you provide:

    \code
    QMessageBox::about( this, "About <Application>",
	"<Application> is a <one-paragraph blurb>\n\n"
	"Copyright 1991-2003 Such-and-such. "
	"<License words here.>\n\n"
	"For technical support, call 1234-56789 or see\n"
	"http://www.such-and-such.com/Application/\n" );
    \endcode

    See about() for more information.

    If you want your users to know that the application is built using
    Qt (so they know that you use high quality tools) you might like
    to add an "About Qt" menu option under the Help menu to invoke
    aboutQt().

    If none of the standard message boxes is suitable, you can create a
    QMessageBox from scratch and use custom button texts:

    \code
    QMessageBox mb( "Application name here",
	"Saving the file will overwrite the original file on the disk.\n"
	"Do you really want to save?",
	QMessageBox::Information,
	QMessageBox::Yes | QMessageBox::Default,
	QMessageBox::No,
	QMessageBox::Cancel | QMessageBox::Escape );
    mb.setButtonText( QMessageBox::Yes, "Save" );
    mb.setButtonText( QMessageBox::No, "Discard" );
    switch( mb.exec() ) {
    case QMessageBox::Yes:
	// save and exit
	break;
    case QMessageBox::No:
	// exit without saving
	break;
    case QMessageBox::Cancel:
	// don't save and don't exit
	break;
    }
    \endcode

    QMessageBox defines two enum types: Icon and an unnamed button type.
    Icon defines the \c Question, \c Information, \c Warning, and \c
    Critical icons for each GUI style. It is used by the constructor
    and by the static member functions question(), information(),
    warning() and critical(). A function called standardIcon() gives
    you access to the various icons.

    The button types are:
    \list
    \i Ok - the default for single-button message boxes
    \i Cancel - note that this is \e not automatically Escape
    \i Yes
    \i No
    \i Abort
    \i Retry
    \i Ignore
    \i YesAll
    \i NoAll
    \endlist

    Button types can be combined with two modifiers by using OR, '|':
    \list
    \i Default - makes pressing Enter equivalent to
    clicking this button. Normally used with Ok, Yes or similar.
    \i Escape - makes pressing Escape equivalent to clicking this button.
    Normally used with Abort, Cancel or similar.
    \endlist

    The text(), icon() and iconPixmap() functions provide access to the
    current text and pixmap of the message box. The setText(), setIcon()
    and setIconPixmap() let you change it. The difference between
    setIcon() and setIconPixmap() is that the former accepts a
    QMessageBox::Icon and can be used to set standard icons, whereas the
    latter accepts a QPixmap and can be used to set custom icons.

    setButtonText() and buttonText() provide access to the buttons.

    QMessageBox has no signals or slots.

}


/*!
    Constructs a message box with a \a caption, a \a text, an \a icon,
    and up to three buttons.

    The \a icon must be one of the following:
    \list
    \i QMessageBox::NoIcon
    \i QMessageBox::Question
    \i QMessageBox::Information
    \i QMessageBox::Warning
    \i QMessageBox::Critical
    \endlist

    Each button, \a button0, \a button1 and \a button2, can have one
    of the following values:
    \list
    \i QMessageBox::NoButton
    \i QMessageBox::Ok
    \i QMessageBox::Cancel
    \i QMessageBox::Yes
    \i QMessageBox::No
    \i QMessageBox::Abort
    \i QMessageBox::Retry
    \i QMessageBox::Ignore
    \i QMessageBox::YesAll
    \i QMessageBox::NoAll
    \endlist

    Use QMessageBox::NoButton for the later parameters to have fewer
    than three buttons in your message box. If you don't specify any
    buttons at all, QMessageBox will provide an Ok button.

    One of the buttons can be OR-ed with the \c QMessageBox::Default
    flag to make it the default button (clicked when Enter is
    pressed).

    One of the buttons can be OR-ed with the \c QMessageBox::Escape
    flag to make it the cancel or close button (clicked when Escape is
    pressed).

    Example:
    \code
    QMessageBox mb( "Application Name",
        "Hardware failure.\n\nDisk error detected\nDo you want to stop?",
        QMessageBox::Question,
        QMessageBox::Yes | QMessageBox::Default,
        QMessageBox::No  | QMessageBox::Escape,
        QMessageBox::NoButton );
    if ( mb.exec() == QMessageBox::No )
        // try again
    \endcode

    If \a parent is 0, the message box becomes an application-global
    modal dialog box. If \a parent is a widget, the message box
    becomes modal relative to \a parent.

    If \a modal is TRUE the message box is modal; otherwise it
    is modeless.

    The \a parent, \a name, \a modal, and \a f arguments are passed to
    the QDialog constructor.
