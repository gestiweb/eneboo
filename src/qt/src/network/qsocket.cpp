  Perhaps this private functionality needs to be refactored.

  Comment from Robert D Gatlin (Intel):

    It would be nice to have the functionality inherent in QSocket available
    as a separate class as a standard part of the Qt library, something along
    the line of:

      class QByteBuffer : public QIODevice { ... }

    The same class could/would be used within QSocket for the Read/Write
    buffers.

    The above class could be used in the following way(s):

	buffer.open( IO_WriteOnly | IO_Append );
	buffer.writeBlock( a ); // a = QByteArray
	buffer.close();

	QByteArray b;
	b.resize( buffer.size() );
	buffer.open( IO_ReadOnly );
	buffer.readBlock( b.data(), b.size() );
	buffer.close();

    But would also be useable with QDataStream (via QIODevice) with:

	buffer.open( IO_WriteOnly | IO_Append );
	QDataStream is( &buffer );
	is << 100;
	buffer.close();

	buffer.open( IO_ReadOnly );
	QDataStream os( &buffer );
	Q_UINT32 x;
	os >> x;
	buffer.close();

    The real usefulness is with any situations where data (QByteArray) arrives
    incrementally (as in QSocket and filter case above).

    I tried using QBuffer, but QBuffer does not trim bytes from the front of
    the buffer in cases like:

	QBuffer buf;
	buf.open( IO_ReadOnly );
	QDataStream ds( &buf );
	Q_INT32 x;
	ds >> x;
	buf.close();

    In the above case, buf.size() will be identical before and after the
    operation with QDataStream. Based on the implementation of QBuffer, it
    does not appear well suited for this kind of operation.

    \class QSocket qsocket.h
    \brief The QSocket class provides a buffered TCP connection.
\if defined(commercial)
    It is part of the <a href="commercialeditions.html">Qt Enterprise Edition</a>.
\endif

    \ingroup io
    \module network

    It provides a totally non-blocking QIODevice, and modifies and
    extends the API of QIODevice with socket-specific code.

    Note that a QApplication must have been constructed before this
    class can be used.

    The functions you're likely to call most are connectToHost(),
    bytesAvailable(), canReadLine() and the ones it inherits from
    QIODevice.

    connectToHost() is the most-used function. As its name implies,
    it opens a connection to a named host.

    Most network protocols are either packet-oriented or
    line-oriented. canReadLine() indicates whether a connection
    contains an entire unread line or not, and bytesAvailable()
    returns the number of bytes available for reading.

    The signals error(), connected(), readyRead() and
    connectionClosed() inform you of the progress of the connection.
    There are also some less commonly used signals. hostFound() is
    emitted when connectToHost() has finished its DNS lookup and is
    starting its TCP connection. delayedCloseFinished() is emitted
    when close() succeeds. bytesWritten() is emitted when QSocket
    moves data from its "to be written" queue into the TCP
    implementation.

    There are several access functions for the socket: state() returns
    whether the object is idle, is doing a DNS lookup, is connecting,
    has an operational connection, etc. address() and port() return
    the IP address and port used for the connection. The peerAddress()
    and peerPort() functions return the IP address and port used by
    the peer, and peerName() returns the name of the peer (normally
    the name that was passed to connectToHost()). socketDevice()
    returns a pointer to the QSocketDevice used for this socket.

    QSocket inherits QIODevice, and reimplements some functions. In
    general, you can treat it as a QIODevice for writing, and mostly
    also for reading. The match isn't perfect, since the QIODevice
    API is designed for devices that are controlled by the same
    machine, and an asynchronous peer-to-peer network connection isn't
    quite like that. For example, there is nothing that matches
    QIODevice::size() exactly. The documentation for open(), close(),
    flush(), size(), at(), atEnd(), readBlock(), writeBlock(),
    getch(), putch(), ungetch() and readLine() describes the
    differences in detail.

    \warning QSocket is not suitable for use in threads. If you need
    to uses sockets in threads use the lower-level QSocketDevice class.

    \warning Because Qt doesn't use the native socketstream
    implementation on Mac OS X, QSocket has an implicit transfer
    latency of 100ms. You can achieve lower latency on Mac OS X by
    using QSocketDevice instead.
