You may use, distribute and copy this software under the terms of GNU General Public License version 2, which is displayed below.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     Esta  es  una  traducción  no  oficial al español de la GNU General
     Public   License.  No  ha  sido  publicada  por  la  Free  Software
     Foundation,   y   no   establece   legalmente  las  condiciones  de
     distribución para el software que usa la GNU GPL. Estas condiciones
     se establecen solamente por el texto original, en inglés, de la GNU
     GPL.  Sin  embargo,  esperamos  que  esta  traducción  ayude  a los
     hispanohablantes a entender mejor la GNU GPL.

     IMPORTANT NOTICE:

     This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General Public License
     into Spanish. It was not published by the Free Software Foundation,
     and does not legally state the distribution terms for software that
     uses  the  GNU  GPL--only  the original English text of the GNU GPL
     does that. However, we hope that this translation will help Spanish
     speakers understand the GNU GPL better.

   Se  permite  la  copia  y  distribución  de  copias  literales de este
   documento, pero no se permite su modificación.

Preámbulo

   Las  licencias  que cubren la mayor parte del software están diseñadas
   para quitarle a usted la libertad de compartirlo y modificarlo. Por el
   contrario, la Licencia Pública General de GNU pretende garantizarle la
   libertad de compartir y modificar software libre, para asegurar que el
   software  es  libre  para  todos  sus  usuarios. Esta Licencia Pública
   General  se  aplica a la mayor parte del software del la Free Software
   Foundation y a cualquier otro programa si sus autores se comprometen a
   utilizarla.  (Existe  otro software de la Free Software Foundation que
   está   cubierto   por   la   Licencia  Pública  General  de  GNU  para
   Bibliotecas).  Si  quiere,  también  puede  aplicarla  a  sus  propios
   programas.

   Cuando  hablamos  de software libre, estamos refiriéndonos a libertad,
   no  a  precio.  Nuestras  Licencias Públicas Generales están diseñadas
   para  asegurarnos  de  que  tenga  la libertad de distribuir copias de
   software libre (y cobrar por ese servicio si quiere), de que reciba el
   código  fuente  o  que  pueda  conseguirlo  si lo quiere, de que pueda
   modificar  el  software  o  usar  fragmentos de él en nuevos programas
   libres, y de que sepa que puede hacer todas estas cosas.

   Para  proteger  sus  derechos  necesitamos  algunas  restricciones que
   prohiban  a  cualquiera  negarle  a usted estos derechos o pedirle que
   renuncie   a   ellos.  Estas  restricciones  se  traducen  en  ciertas
   obligaciones que le afectan si distribuye copias del software, o si lo
   modifica.

   Por  ejemplo,  si  distribuye  copias  de  uno de estos programas, sea
   gratuitamente,  o  a  cambio  de  una contraprestación, debe dar a los
   receptores  todos los derechos que tiene. Debe asegurarse de que ellos
   también  reciben,  o  pueden  conseguir,  el  código  fuente.  Y  debe
   mostrarles estas condiciones de forma que conozcan sus derechos.

   Protegemos sus derechos con la combinación de dos medidas:
    1. Ponemos el software bajo copyright y
    2. le  ofrecemos  esta licencia, que le da permiso legal para copiar,
       distribuir y/o modificar el software.

   También,  para  la  protección  de  cada  autor  y  la nuestra propia,
   queremos  asegurarnos  de  que  todo  el  mundo  comprende  que  no se
   proporciona  ninguna garantía para este software libre. Si el software
   se modifica por cualquiera y éste a su vez lo distribuye, queremos que
   sus receptores sepan que lo que tienen no es el original, de forma que
   cualquier  problema introducido por otros no afecte a la reputación de
   los autores originales.

   Por último, cualquier programa libre está constantemente amenazado por
   patentes  sobre  el  software.  Queremos  evitar el peligro de que los
   redistribuidores de un programa libre obtengan patentes por su cuenta,
   convirtiendo  de  facto  el programa en propietario. Para evitar esto,
   hemos  dejado  claro que cualquier patente debe ser pedida para el uso
   libre de cualquiera, o no ser pedida.

   Los  términos  exactos y las condiciones para la copia, distribución y
   modificación se exponen a continuación.

Términos y condiciones para la copia, distribución y modificación

    1. Esta  Licencia  se  aplica  a  cualquier  programa  u otro tipo de
       trabajo  que  contenga  una  nota  colocada  por  el  tenedor  del
       copyright  diciendo que puede ser distribuido bajo los términos de
       esta Licencia Pública General. En adelante, «Programa» se referirá
       a cualquier programa o trabajo que cumpla esa condición y «trabajo
       basado  en el Programa» se referirá bien al Programa o a cualquier
       trabajo  derivado  de  él  según  la ley de copyright. Esto es, un
       trabajo  que  contenga  el  programa  o una proción de él, bien en
       forma literal o con modificaciones y/o traducido en otro lenguaje.
       Por  lo  tanto, la traducción está incluida sin limitaciones en el
       término  «modificación».  Cada  concesionario (licenciatario) será
       denominado «usted».
       Cualquier  otra  actividad  que  no  sea  la copia, distribución o
       modificación  no está cubierta por esta Licencia, está fuera de su
       ámbito. El acto de ejecutar el Programa no está restringido, y los
       resultados   del   Programa  están  cubiertos  únicamente  si  sus
       contenidos   constituyen   un   trabajo  basado  en  el  Programa,
       independientemente  de haberlo producido mediante la ejecución del
       programa.  El  que  esto  se  cumpla,  depende  de  lo que haga el
       programa.
    2. Usted puede copiar y distribuir copias literales del código fuente
       del  Programa, según lo has recibido, en cualquier medio, supuesto
       que  de  forma  adecuada  y bien visible publique en cada copia un
       anuncio  de  copyright adecuado y un repudio de garantía, mantenga
       intactos todos los anuncios que se refieran a esta Licencia y a la
       ausencia  de garantía, y proporcione a cualquier otro receptor del
       programa una copia de esta Licencia junto con el Programa.
       Puede cobrar un precio por el acto físico de transferir una copia,
       y  puede,  según  su  libre albedrío, ofrecer garantía a cambio de
       unos honorarios.
    3. Puede  modificar  su  copia  o  copias del Programa o de cualquier
       porción  de  él,  formando  de esta manera un trabajo basado en el
       Programa,  y  copiar  y distribuir esa modificación o trabajo bajo
       los términos del apartado 1, antedicho, supuesto que además cumpla
       las siguientes condiciones:
         a. Debe  hacer  que  los  ficheros  modificados  lleven anuncios
            prominentes  indicando  que  los  ha  cambiado  y la fecha de
            cualquier cambio.
         b. Debe  hacer que cualquier trabajo que distribuya o publique y
            que en todo o en parte contenga o sea derivado del Programa o
            de  cualquier  parte  de  él sea licenciada como un todo, sin
            carga alguna, a todas las terceras partes y bajo los términos
            de esta Licencia.
         c. Si   el   programa   modificado   lee   normalmente   órdenes
            interactivamente  cuando es ejecutado, debe hacer que, cuando
            comience  su  ejecución  para ese uso interactivo de la forma
            más  habitual,  muestre  o  escriba un mensaje que incluya un
            anuncio de copyright y un anuncio de que no se ofrece ninguna
            garantía (o por el contrario que sí se ofrece garantía) y que
            los  usuarios  pueden  redistribuir  el  programa  bajo estas
            condiciones,  e  indicando  al  usuario cómo ver una copia de
            esta   licencia.   (Excepción:   si  el  propio  programa  es
            interactivo  pero  normalmente  no muestra ese anuncio, no se
            requiere  que su trabajo basado en el Programa muestre ningún
            anuncio).
       Estos requisitos se aplican al trabajo modificado como un todo. Si
       partes   identificables  de  ese  trabajo  no  son  derivadas  del
       Programa,  y  pueden,  razonablemente,  ser  consideradas trabajos
       independientes   y  separados  por  ellos  mismos,  entonces  esta
       Licencia  y  sus  términos no se aplican a esas partes cuando sean
       distribuidas  como trabajos separados. Pero cuando distribuya esas
       mismas  secciones  como partes de un todo que es un trabajo basado
       en  el  Programa,  la  distribución  del  todo  debe ser según los
       términos   de   esta   licencia,   cuyos   permisos   para   otros
       licenciatarios  se  extienden  al  todo completo, y por lo tanto a
       todas  y  cada  una  de  sus partes, con independencia de quién la
       escribió.
       Por  lo  tanto,  no  es  la  intención  de  este apartado reclamar
       derechos   o   desafiar   sus  derechos  sobre  trabajos  escritos
       totalmente  por  usted  mismo.  El intento es ejercer el derecho a
       controlar  la  distribución  de  trabajos  derivados  o colectivos
       basados en el Programa.
       Además,  el  simple  hecho  de  reunir  un trabajo no basado en el
       Programa  con el Programa (o con un trabajo basado en el Programa)
       en  un  volumen de almacenamiento o en un medio de distribución no
       hace  que  dicho trabajo entre dentro del ámbito cubierto por esta
       Licencia.
    4. Puede  copiar y distribuir el Programa (o un trabajo basado en él,
       según  se  especifica  en  el  apartado 2, como código objeto o en
       formato  ejecutable  según  los  términos  de los apartados 1 y 2,
       supuesto que además cumpla una de las siguientes condiciones:
         a. Acompañarlo con el código fuente completo correspondiente, en
            formato  electrónico,  que  debe  ser  distribuido  según  se
            especifica  en  los  apartados  1  y 2 de esta Licencia en un
            medio   habitualmente   utilizado   para  el  intercambio  de
            programas, o
         b. Acompañarlo  con  una  oferta  por escrito, válida durante al
            menos  tres  años,  de proporcionar a cualquier tercera parte
            una  copia  completa en formato electrónico del código fuente
            correspondiente,  a  un  coste  no  mayor  que el de realizar
            físicamente  la distribución del fuente, que será distribuido
            bajo  las  condiciones  descritas  en  los  apartados  1  y 2
            anteriores,  en  un  medio  habitualmente  utilizado  para el
            intercambio de programas, o
         c. Acompañarlo  con  la  información  que  recibiste  ofreciendo
            distribuir  el código fuente correspondiente. (Esta opción se
            permite  sólo  para distribución no comercial y sólo si usted
            recibió   el   programa  como  código  objeto  o  en  formato
            ejecutable  con  tal  oferta,  de  acuerdo  con el apartado b
            anterior).
       Por código fuente de un trabajo se entiende la forma preferida del
       trabajo  cuando  se  le  hacen  modificaciones.  Para  un  trabajo
       ejecutable,  se entiende por código fuente completo todo el código
       fuente  para todos los módulos que contiene, más cualquier fichero
       asociado  de  definición de interfaces, más los guiones utilizados
       para  controlar  la compilación e instalación del ejecutable. Como
       excepción  especial  el  código  fuente  distribuido  no  necesita
       incluir  nada  que  sea distribuido normalmente (bien como fuente,
       bien   en   forma   binaria)   con   los  componentes  principales
       (compilador,  kernel y similares) del sistema operativo en el cual
       funciona el ejecutable, a no ser que el propio componente acompañe
       al ejecutable.
       Si  la  distribución  del  ejecutable  o del código objeto se hace
       mediante  la  oferta  acceso  para  copiarlo  de  un cierto lugar,
       entonces  se  considera  la oferta de acceso para copiar el código
       fuente  del  mismo  lugar  como  distribución  del  código fuente,
       incluso  aunque  terceras  partes  no  estén  forzadas a copiar el
       fuente junto con el código objeto.
    5. No  puede copiar, modificar, sublicenciar o distribuir el Programa
       excepto  como  prevé expresamente esta Licencia. Cualquier intento
       de copiar, modificar sublicenciar o distribuir el Programa de otra
       forma  es  inválida, y hará que cesen automáticamente los derechos
       que  te  proporciona  esta Licencia. En cualquier caso, las partes
       que  hayan  recibido copias o derechos de usted bajo esta Licencia
       no   cesarán  en  sus  derechos  mientras  esas  partes  continúen
       cumpliéndola.
    6. No está obligado a aceptar esta licencia, ya que no la ha firmado.
       Sin  embargo,  no  hay  nada  más  que le proporcione permiso para
       modificar o distribuir el Programa o sus trabajos derivados. Estas
       acciones  están  prohibidas por la ley si no acepta esta Licencia.
       Por  lo  tanto,  si modifica o distribuye el Programa (o cualquier
       trabajo  basado  en  el  Programa), está indicando que acepta esta
       Licencia  para  poder  hacerlo, y todos sus términos y condiciones
       para copiar, distribuir o modificar el Programa o trabajos basados
       en él.
    7. Cada  vez que redistribuya el Programa (o cualquier trabajo basado
       en  el  Programa), el receptor recibe automáticamente una licencia
       del  licenciatario original para copiar, distribuir o modificar el
       Programa, de forma sujeta a estos términos y condiciones. No puede
       imponer  al receptor ninguna restricción más sobre el ejercicio de
       los  derechos  aquí garantizados. No es usted responsable de hacer
       cumplir esta licencia por terceras partes.
    8. Si como consecuencia de una resolución judicial o de una alegación
       de infracción de patente o por cualquier otra razón (no limitada a
       asuntos  relacionados  con patentes) se le imponen condiciones (ya
       sea  por mandato judicial, por acuerdo o por cualquier otra causa)
       que contradigan las condiciones de esta Licencia, ello no le exime
       de  cumplir las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si no puede realizar
       distribuciones  de  forma  que  se  satisfagan simultáneamente sus
       obligaciones  bajo  esta  licencia  y  cualquier  otra  obligación
       pertinente  entonces,  como  consecuencia,  no puede distribuir el
       Programa  de ninguna forma. Por ejemplo, si una patente no permite
       la  redistribución  libre  de  derechos  de autor del Programa por
       parte   de   todos   aquellos   que   reciban   copias  directa  o
       indirectamente  a  través de usted, entonces la única forma en que
       podría  satisfacer  tanto  esa  condición como esta Licencia sería
       evitar completamente la distribución del Programa.
       Si  cualquier  porción  de  este  apartado se considera inválida o
       imposible de cumplir bajo cualquier circunstancia particular ha de
       cumplirse  el  resto  y  la  sección por entero ha de cumplirse en
       cualquier otra circunstancia.
       No  es el propósito de este apartado inducirle a infringir ninguna
       reivindicación de patente ni de ningún otro derecho de propiedad o
       impugnar  la  validez  de ninguna de dichas reivindicaciones. Este
       apartado  tiene  el  único propósito de proteger la integridad del
       sistema de distribución de software libre, que se realiza mediante
       prácticas de licencia pública. Mucha gente ha hecho contribuciones
       generosas  a la gran variedad de software distribuido mediante ese
       sistema   con   la   confianza  de  que  el  sistema  se  aplicará
       consistentemente.  Será  el  autor/donante  quien decida si quiere
       distribuir software mediante cualquier otro sistema y una licencia
       no puede imponer esa elección.
       Este  apartado  pretende  dejar completamente claro lo que se cree
       que es una consecuencia del resto de esta Licencia.
    9. Si  la  distribución  y/o  uso  de el Programa está restringida en
       ciertos países, bien por patentes o por interfaces bajo copyright,
       el  tenedor  del  copyright  que  coloca  este  Programa bajo esta
       Licencia  puede  añadir  una  limitación explícita de distribución
       geográfica excluyendo esos países, de forma que la distribución se
       permita sólo en o entre los países no excluidos de esta manera. En
       ese   caso,  esta  Licencia  incorporará  la  limitación  como  si
       estuviese escrita en el cuerpo de esta Licencia.
   10. La Free Software Foundation puede publicar versiones revisadas y/o
       nuevas  de la Licencia Pública General de tiempo en tiempo. Dichas
       nuevas  versiones  serán  similares  en  espíritu  a  la  presente
       versión,  pero  pueden  ser diferentes en detalles para considerar
       nuevos problemas o situaciones.
       Cada  versión  recibe  un  número  de  versión que la distingue de
       otras.  Si  el  Programa  especifica  un número de versión de esta
       Licencia  que se refiere a ella y a «cualquier versión posterior»,
       tienes la opción de seguir los términos y condiciones, bien de esa
       versión, bien de cualquier versión posterior publicada por la Free
       Software  Foundation.  Si  el  Programa no especifica un número de
       versión   de  esta  Licencia,  puedes  escoger  cualquier  versión
       publicada por la Free Software Foundation.
   11. Si quiere incorporar partes del Programa en otros programas libres
       cuyas condiciones de distribución son diferentes, escribe al autor
       para  pedirle  permiso.  Si el software tiene copyright de la Free
       Software  Foundation,  escribe  a  la  Free  Software  Foundation:
       algunas veces hacemos excepciones en estos casos. Nuestra decisión
       estará guiada por el doble objetivo de de preservar la libertad de
       todos los derivados de nuestro software libre y promover el que se
       comparta y reutilice el software en general.

AUSENCIA DE GARANTÍA

   12. Como el programa se licencia libre de cargas, no se ofrece ninguna
       garantía sobre el programa, en todas la extensión permitida por la
       legislación aplicable. Excepto cuando se indique de otra forma por
       escrito, los tenedores del copyright y/u otras partes proporcionan
       el  programa  «tal  cual»,  sin  garantía  de  ninguna clase, bien
       expresa  o  implícita,  con  inclusión,  pero sin limitación a las
       garantías  mercantiles  implícitas  o  a  la  conveniencia para un
       propósito  particular.  Cualquier  riesgo referente a la calidad y
       prestaciones  del programa es asumido por usted. Si se probase que
       el  Programa  es defectuoso, asume el coste de cualquier servicio,
       reparación o corrección.
   13. En  ningún  caso, salvo que lo requiera la legislación aplicable o
       haya  sido  acordado  por escrito, ningún tenedor del copyright ni
       ninguna  otra  parte  que  modifique  y/o redistribuya el Programa
       según  se permite en esta Licencia será responsable ante usted por
       daños,  incluyendo  cualquier daño general, especial, incidental o
       resultante  producido  por  el  uso  o la imposibilidad de uso del
       Programa (con inclusión, pero sin limitación a la pérdida de datos
       o  a  la  generación incorrecta de datos o a pérdidas sufridas por
       usted o por terceras partes o a un fallo del Programa al funcionar
       en  combinación  con  cualquier  otro  programa), incluso si dicho
       tenedor u otra parte ha sido advertido de la posibilidad de dichos
       daños.
