                                Release Notes

                                Release 8.1.4

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.3, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.1.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 may require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       may require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote is
       in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations and standard_conforming_strings
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also
       future-proofs them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard
       string literal syntax. Applications that use multiple PostgreSQL
       connections concurrently should migrate to PQescapeStringConn() and
       PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that escaping is done correctly for
       the settings in use in each database connection. Applications that
       do string escaping "by hand" should be modified to rely on library
       routines instead.
     * Fix weak key selection in pgcrypto (Marko Kreen)
       Errors in fortuna PRNG reseeding logic could cause a predictable
       session key to be selected by pgp_sym_encrypt() in some cases. This
       only affects non-OpenSSL-using builds.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, win866_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Make autovacuum visible in pg_stat_activity (Alvaro)
     * Disable full_page_writes (Tom)
       In certain cases, having full_page_writes off would cause crash
       recovery to fail. A proper fix will appear in 8.2; for now it's
       just disabled.
     * Various planner fixes, particularly for bitmap index scans and
       MIN/MAX optimization (Tom)
     * Fix incorrect optimization in merge join (Tom)
       Outer joins could sometimes emit multiple copies of unmatched rows.
     * Fix crash from using and modifying a plpgsql function in the same
       transaction
     * Fix WAL replay for case where a btree index has been truncated
     * Fix SIMILAR TO for patterns involving | (Tom)
     * Fix "SELECT INTO" and "CREATE TABLE AS" to create tables in the
       default tablespace, not the base directory (Kris Jurka)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Improve qsort performance (Dann Corbit)
       Currently this code is only used on Solaris.
     * Fix for Bonjour on Intel Macs (Ashley Clark)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks
     * Fix problem with password prompting on some Win32 systems (Robert
       Kinberg)
     * Improve pg_dump's handling of default values for domains
     * Fix pg_dumpall to handle identically-named users and groups
       reasonably (only possible when dumping from a pre-8.1 server) (Tom)
       The user and group will be merged into a single role with LOGIN
       permission. Formerly the merged role wouldn't have LOGIN
       permission, making it unusable as a user.
     * Fix pg_restore -n to work as documented (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.3

     Release date: 2006-02-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.2, including one very
   serious security issue.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.1.3

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.1.2, see the release notes
   for 8.1.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix bug that allowed any logged-in user to "SET ROLE" to any other
       database user id (CVE-2006-0553)
       Due to inadequate validity checking, a user could exploit the
       special case that "SET ROLE" normally uses to restore the previous
       role setting after an error. This allowed ordinary users to acquire
       superuser status, for example. The escalation-of-privilege risk
       exists only in 8.1.0-8.1.2. However, in all releases back to 7.3
       there is a related bug in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" that allows
       unprivileged users to crash the server, if it has been compiled
       with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to Akio
       Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 8.0.4, 7.4.9, and 7.3.11 releases. */
       #if 0
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog and pg_subtrans file creation (Tom)
     * Fix cases that could lead to crashes if a cache-invalidation
       message arrives at just the wrong time (Tom)
     * Properly check DOMAIN constraints for UNKNOWN parameters in
       prepared statements (Neil)
     * Ensure "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" will process FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and
       PRIMARY KEY constraints in the proper order (Nakano Yoshihisa)
     * Fixes to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators or operator classes (Tom)
     * Allow pg_restore to continue properly after a "COPY" failure;
       formerly it tried to treat the remaining "COPY" data as SQL
       commands (Stephen Frost)
     * Fix pg_ctl unregister crash when the data directory is not
       specified (Magnus)
     * Fix libpq PQprint HTML tags (Christoph Zwerschke)
     * Fix ecpg crash on AMD64 and PPC (Neil)
     * Allow SETOF and %TYPE to be used together in function result type
       declarations
     * Recover properly if error occurs during argument passing in
       PL/python (Neil)
     * Fix memory leak in plperl_return_next (Neil)
     * Fix PL/perl's handling of locales on Win32 to match the backend
       (Andrew)
     * Various optimizer fixes (Tom)
     * Fix crash when log_min_messages is set to DEBUG3 or above in
       "postgresql.conf" on Win32 (Bruce)
     * Fix pgxs -L library path specification for Win32, Cygwin, OS X, AIX
       (Bruce)
     * Check that SID is enabled while checking for Win32 admin privileges
       (Magnus)
     * Properly reject out-of-range date inputs (Kris Jurka)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)
     * Improve speed of "COPY IN" via libpq, by avoiding a kernel call per
       data line (Alon Goldshuv)
     * Improve speed of "/contrib/tsearch2" index creation (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.1.2

     Release date: 2006-01-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.1.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X. However, you
   might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns after updating, if
   you are affected by the locale or plperl issues described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix Windows code so that postmaster will continue rather than exit
       if there is no more room in ShmemBackendArray (Magnus)
       The previous behavior could lead to a denial-of-service situation
       if too many connection requests arrive close together. This applies
       *only* to the Windows port.
     * Fix bug introduced in 8.0 that could allow ReadBuffer to return an
       already-used page as new, potentially causing loss of
       recently-committed data (Tom)
     * Fix for protocol-level Describe messages issued outside a
       transaction or in a failed transaction (Tom)
     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You may need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Allow more flexible relocation of installation directories (Tom)
       Previous releases supported relocation only if all installation
       directory paths were the same except for the last component.
     * Prevent crashes caused by the use of ISO-8859-5 and ISO-8859-9
       encodings (Tatsuo)
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Fix bug where COPY CSV mode considered any \. to terminate the copy
       data
       The new code requires \. to appear alone on a line, as per
       documentation.
     * Make COPY CSV mode quote a literal data value of \. to ensure it
       cannot be interpreted as the end-of-data marker (Bruce)
     * Various fixes for functions returning RECORDs (Tom)
     * Fix processing of "postgresql.conf" so a final line with no newline
       is processed properly (Tom)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix autovacuum crash when processing expression indexes
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)

                                Release 8.1.1

     Release date: 2005-12-12

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.1.1

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix incorrect optimizations of outer-join conditions (Tom)
     * Fix problems with wrong reported column names in cases involving
       sub-selects flattened by the optimizer (Tom)
     * Fix update failures in scenarios involving CHECK constraints,
       toasted columns, *and* indexes (Tom)
     * Fix bgwriter problems after recovering from errors (Tom)
       The background writer was found to leak buffer pins after write
       errors. While not fatal in itself, this might lead to mysterious
       blockages of later VACUUM commands.
     * Prevent failure if client sends Bind protocol message when current
       transaction is already aborted
     * "/contrib/tsearch2" and "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix problems with translated error messages in languages that
       require word reordering, such as Turkish; also problems with
       unexpected truncation of output strings and wrong display of the
       smallest possible bigint value (Andrew, Tom)
       These problems only appeared on platforms that were using our
       "port/snprintf.c" code, which includes BSD variants if --enable-nls
       was given, and perhaps others. In addition, a different form of the
       translated-error-message problem could appear on Windows depending
       on which version of "libintl" was used.
     * Re-allow AM/PM, HH, HH12, and D format specifiers for to_char(time)
       and to_char(interval). (to_char(interval) should probably use
       HH24.) (Bruce)
     * AIX, HPUX, and MSVC compile fixes (Tom, Hiroshi Saito)
     * Optimizer improvements (Tom)
     * Retry file reads and writes after Windows NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES error
       (Qingqing Zhou)
     * Prevent autovacuum from crashing during ANALYZE of expression index
       (Alvaro)
     * Fix problems with ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS temp tables
     * Fix problems when a trigger alters the output of a SELECT DISTINCT
       query
     * Add 8.1.0 release note item on how to migrate invalid UTF-8 byte
       sequences (Paul Lindner)

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   Improve concurrent access to the shared buffer cache (Tom)
          Access to the shared buffer cache was identified as a
          significant scalability problem, particularly on multi-CPU
          systems. In this release, the way that locking is done in the
          buffer manager has been overhauled to reduce lock contention and
          improve scalability. The buffer manager has also been changed to
          use a "clock sweep" replacement policy.

   Allow index scans to use an intermediate in-memory bitmap (Tom)
          In previous releases, only a single index could be used to do
          lookups on a table. With this feature, if a query has "WHERE
          tab.col1 = 4 and tab.col2 = 9", and there is no multicolumn
          index on col1 and col2, but there is an index on col1 and
          another on col2, it is possible to search both indexes and
          combine the results in memory, then do heap fetches for only the
          rows matching both the col1 and col2 restrictions. This is very
          useful in environments that have a lot of unstructured queries
          where it is impossible to create indexes that match all possible
          access conditions. Bitmap scans are useful even with a single
          index, as they reduce the amount of random access needed; a
          bitmap index scan is efficient for retrieving fairly large
          fractions of the complete table, whereas plain index scans are
          not.

   Add two-phase commit (Heikki Linnakangas, Alvaro, Tom)
          Two-phase commit allows transactions to be "prepared" on several
          computers, and once all computers have successfully prepared
          their transactions (none failed), all transactions can be
          committed. Even if a machine crashes after a prepare, the
          prepared transaction can be committed after the machine is
          restarted. New syntax includes "PREPARE TRANSACTION" and
          "COMMIT/ROLLBACK PREPARED". A new system view pg_prepared_xacts
          has also been added.

   Create a new role system that replaces users and groups (Stephen Frost)
          Roles are a combination of users and groups. Like users, they
          can have login capability, and like groups, a role can have
          other roles as members. Roles basically remove the distinction
          between users and groups. For example, a role can:

          + Have login capability (optionally)
          + Own objects
          + Hold access permissions for database objects
          + Inherit permissions from other roles it is a member of

          Once a user logs into a role, she obtains capabilities of the
          login role plus any inherited roles, and can use "SET ROLE" to
          switch to other roles she is a member of. This feature is a
          generalization of the SQL standard's concept of roles. This
          change also replaces pg_shadow and pg_group by new role-capable
          catalogs pg_authid and pg_auth_members. The old tables are
          redefined as read-only views on the new role tables.

   Automatically use indexes for MIN() and MAX() (Tom)
          In previous releases, the only way to use an index for MIN() or
          MAX() was to rewrite the query as "SELECT col FROM tab ORDER BY
          col LIMIT 1". Index usage now happens automatically.

   Move /contrib/pg_autovacuum into the main server (Alvaro)
          Integrating autovacuum into the server allows it to be
          automatically started and stopped in sync with the database
          server, and allows autovacuum to be configured from
          "postgresql.conf".

   Add shared row level locks using SELECT ... FOR SHARE (Alvaro)
          While PostgreSQL's MVCC locking allows "SELECT" to never be
          blocked by writers and therefore does not need shared row locks
          for typical operations, shared locks are useful for applications
          that require shared row locking. In particular this reduces the
          locking requirements imposed by referential integrity checks.

   Add dependencies on shared objects, specifically roles (Alvaro)
          This extension of the dependency mechanism prevents roles from
          being dropped while there are still database objects they own.
          Formerly it was possible to accidentally "orphan" objects by
          deleting their owner. While this could be recovered from, it was
          messy and unpleasant.

   Improve performance for partitioned tables (Simon)
          The new constraint_exclusion configuration parameter avoids
          lookups on child tables where constraints indicate that no
          matching rows exist in the child table.

          This allows for a basic type of table partitioning. If child
          tables store separate key ranges and this is enforced using
          appropriate "CHECK" constraints, the optimizer will skip child
          table accesses when the constraint guarantees no matching rows
          exist in the child table.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.1

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   The 8.0 release announced that the to_char() function for intervals
   would be removed in 8.1. However, since no better API has been
   suggested, to_char(interval) has been enhanced in 8.1 and will remain
   in the server.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * add_missing_from is now false by default (Neil)
       By default, we now generate an error if a table is used in a query
       without a FROM reference. The old behavior is still available, but
       the parameter must be set to 'true' to obtain it.
       It may be necessary to set add_missing_from to true in order to
       load an existing dump file, if the dump contains any views or rules
       created using the implicit-FROM syntax. This should be a one-time
       annoyance, because PostgreSQL 8.1 will convert such views and rules
       to standard explicit-FROM syntax. Subsequent dumps will therefore
       not have the problem.
     * Cause input of a zero-length string ('') for float4/float8/oid to
       throw an error, rather than treating it as a zero (Neil)
       This change is consistent with the current handling of zero-length
       strings for integers. The schedule for this change was announced in
       8.0.
     * default_with_oids is now false by default (Neil)
       With this option set to false, user-created tables no longer have
       an OID column unless "WITH OIDS" is specified in "CREATE TABLE".
       Though OIDs have existed in all releases of PostgreSQL, their use
       is limited because they are only four bytes long and the counter is
       shared across all installed databases. The preferred way of
       uniquely identifying rows is via sequences and the SERIAL type,
       which have been supported since PostgreSQL 6.4.
     * Add E'' syntax so eventually ordinary strings can treat backslashes
       literally (Bruce)
       Currently PostgreSQL processes a backslash in a string literal as
       introducing a special escape sequence, e.g. \n or \010. While this
       allows easy entry of special values, it is nonstandard and makes
       porting of applications from other databases more difficult. For
       this reason, the PostgreSQL project is planning to remove the
       special meaning of backslashes in strings. For backward
       compatibility and for users who want special backslash processing,
       a new string syntax has been created. This new string syntax is
       formed by writing an E immediately preceding the single quote that
       starts the string, e.g. E'hi\n'. While this release does not change
       the handling of backslashes in strings, it does add new
       configuration parameters to help users migrate applications for
       future releases:
          + standard_conforming_strings -- does this release treat
            backslashes literally in ordinary strings?
          + escape_string_warning -- warn about backslashes in ordinary
            (non-E) strings
       The standard_conforming_strings value is read-only. Applications
       can retrieve the value to know how backslashes are processed.
       (Presence of the parameter can also be taken as an indication that
       E'' string syntax is supported.) In a future release,
       standard_conforming_strings will be true, meaning backslashes will
       be treated literally in non-E strings. To prepare for this change,
       use E'' strings in places that need special backslash processing,
       and turn on escape_string_warning to find additional strings that
       need to be converted to use E''. Also, use two single-quotes ('')
       to embed a literal single-quote in a string, rather than the
       PostgreSQL-supported syntax of backslash single-quote (\'). The
       former is standards-conforming and does not require the use of the
       E'' string syntax. You can also use the $$ string syntax, which
       does not treat backslashes specially.

     * Make "REINDEX DATABASE" reindex all indexes in the database (Tom)
       Formerly, "REINDEX DATABASE" reindexed only system tables. This new
       behavior seems more intuitive. A new command "REINDEX SYSTEM"
       provides the old functionality of reindexing just the system
       tables.
     * Read-only large object descriptors now obey MVCC snapshot semantics
       When a large object is opened with INV_READ (and not INV_WRITE),
       the data read from the descriptor will now reflect a "snapshot" of
       the large object's state at the time of the transaction snapshot in
       use by the query that called lo_open(). To obtain the old behavior
       of always returning the latest committed data, include INV_WRITE in
       the mode flags for lo_open().
     * Add proper dependencies for arguments of sequence functions (Tom)
       In previous releases, sequence names passed to nextval(),
       currval(), and setval() were stored as simple text strings, meaning
       that renaming or dropping a sequence used in a DEFAULT clause made
       the clause invalid. This release stores all newly-created sequence
       function arguments as internal OIDs, allowing them to track
       sequence renaming, and adding dependency information that prevents
       improper sequence removal. It also makes such DEFAULT clauses
       immune to schema renaming and search path changes.
       Some applications might rely on the old behavior of run-time lookup
       for sequence names. This can still be done by explicitly casting
       the argument to text, for example nextval('myseq'::text).
       Pre-8.1 database dumps loaded into 8.1 will use the old text-based
       representation and therefore will not have the features of
       OID-stored arguments. However, it is possible to update a database
       containing text-based DEFAULT clauses. First, save this query into
       a file, such as "fixseq.sql":
SELECT  'ALTER TABLE ' ||
    pg_catalog.quote_ident(n.nspname) || '.' ||
    pg_catalog.quote_ident(c.relname) ||
    ' ALTER COLUMN ' || pg_catalog.quote_ident(a.attname) ||
    ' SET DEFAULT ' ||
    regexp_replace(d.adsrc,
                   $$val\(\(('[^']*')::text\)::regclass$$,
                   $$val(\1$$,
                   'g') ||
    ';'
FROM    pg_namespace n, pg_class c, pg_attribute a, pg_attrdef d
WHERE   n.oid = c.relnamespace AND
    c.oid = a.attrelid AND
    a.attrelid = d.adrelid AND
    a.attnum = d.adnum AND
    d.adsrc ~ $$val\(\('[^']*'::text\)::regclass$$;
       Next, run the query against a database to find what adjustments are
       required, like this for database db1:
psql -t -f fixseq.sql db1
       This will show the "ALTER TABLE" commands needed to convert the
       database to the newer OID-based representation. If the commands
       look reasonable, run this to update the database:
psql -t -f fixseq.sql db1 | psql -e db1
       This process must be repeated in each database to be updated.
     * In psql, treat unquoted \{digit}+ sequences as octal (Bruce)
       In previous releases, \{digit}+ sequences were treated as decimal,
       and only \0{digit}+ were treated as octal. This change was made for
       consistency.
     * Remove grammar productions for prefix and postfix % and ^ operators
       (Tom)
       These have never been documented and complicated the use of the
       modulus operator (%) with negative numbers.
     * Make &< and &> for polygons consistent with the box "over"
       operators (Tom)
     * "CREATE LANGUAGE" may ignore the provided arguments in favor of
       information from pg_pltemplate (Tom)
       A new system catalog pg_pltemplate has been defined to carry
       information about the preferred definitions of procedural languages
       (such as whether they have validator functions). When an entry
       exists in this catalog for the language being created, "CREATE
       LANGUAGE" will ignore all its parameters except the language name
       and instead use the catalog information. This measure was taken
       because of increasing problems with obsolete language definitions
       being loaded by old dump files. As of 8.1, pg_dump will dump
       procedural language definitions as just "CREATE LANGUAGE name",
       relying on a template entry to exist at load time. We expect this
       will be a more future-proof representation.
     * Make pg_cancel_backend(int) return a boolean rather than an integer
       (Neil)
     * Some users are having problems loading UTF-8 data into 8.1.X. This
       is because previous versions allowed invalid UTF-8 byte sequences
       to be entered into the database, and this release properly accepts
       only valid UTF-8 sequences. One way to correct a dumpfile is to run
       the command "iconv -c -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 -o cleanfile.sql
       dumpfile.sql". The -c option removes invalid character sequences. A
       diff of the two files will show the sequences that are invalid.
       "iconv" reads the entire input file into memory so it might be
       necessary to use split to break up the dump into multiple smaller
       files for processing.

Additional Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the additional changes
   between PostgreSQL 8.1 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance Improvements

     * Improve GiST and R-tree index performance (Neil)
     * Improve the optimizer, including auto-resizing of hash joins (Tom)
     * Overhaul internal API in several areas
     * Change WAL record CRCs from 64-bit to 32-bit (Tom)
       We determined that the extra cost of computing 64-bit CRCs was
       significant, and the gain in reliability too marginal to justify
       it.
     * Prevent writing large empty gaps in WAL pages (Tom)
     * Improve spinlock behavior on SMP machines, particularly Opterons
       (Tom)
     * Allow nonconsecutive index columns to be used in a multicolumn
       index (Tom)
       For example, this allows an index on columns a,b,c to be used in a
       query with "WHERE a = 4 and c = 10".
     * Skip WAL logging for "CREATE TABLE AS" / "SELECT INTO" (Simon)
       Since a crash during "CREATE TABLE AS" would cause the table to be
       dropped during recovery, there is no reason to WAL log as the table
       is loaded. (Logging still happens if WAL archiving is enabled,
       however.)
     * Allow concurrent GIST index access (Teodor, Oleg)
     * Add configuration parameter full_page_writes to control writing
       full pages to WAL (Bruce)
       To prevent partial disk writes from corrupting the database,
       PostgreSQL writes a complete copy of each database disk page to WAL
       the first time it is modified after a checkpoint. This option turns
       off that functionality for more speed. This is safe to use with
       battery-backed disk caches where partial page writes cannot happen.
     * Use O_DIRECT if available when using O_SYNC for wal_sync_method
       (Itagaki Takahiro)
       O_DIRECT causes disk writes to bypass the kernel cache, and for WAL
       writes, this improves performance.
     * Improve "COPY FROM" performance (Alon Goldshuv)
       This was accomplished by reading "COPY" input in larger chunks,
       rather than character by character.
     * Improve the performance of COUNT(), SUM, AVG(), STDDEV(), and
       VARIANCE() (Neil, Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Changes

     * Prevent problems due to transaction ID (XID) wraparound (Tom)
       The server will now warn when the transaction counter approaches
       the wraparound point. If the counter becomes too close to
       wraparound, the server will stop accepting queries. This ensures
       that data is not lost before needed vacuuming is performed.
     * Fix problems with object IDs (OIDs) conflicting with existing
       system objects after the OID counter has wrapped around (Tom)
     * Add warning about the need to increase max_fsm_relations and
       max_fsm_pages during "VACUUM" (Ron Mayer)
     * Add temp_buffers configuration parameter to allow users to
       determine the size of the local buffer area for temporary table
       access (Tom)
     * Add session start time and client IP address to pg_stat_activity
       (Magnus)
     * Adjust pg_stat views for bitmap scans (Tom)
       The meanings of some of the fields have changed slightly.
     * Enhance pg_locks view (Tom)
     * Log queries for client-side "PREPARE" and "EXECUTE" (Simon)
     * Allow Kerberos name and user name case sensitivity to be specified
       in "postgresql.conf" (Magnus)
     * Add configuration parameter krb_server_hostname so that the server
       host name can be specified as part of service principal (Todd
       Kover)
       If not set, any service principal matching an entry in the keytab
       can be used. This is new Kerberos matching behavior in this
       release.
     * Add log_line_prefix options for millisecond timestamps (%m) and
       remote host (%h) (Ed L.)
     * Add WAL logging for GIST indexes (Teodor, Oleg)
       GIST indexes are now safe for crash and point-in-time recovery.
     * Remove old "*.backup" files when we do pg_stop_backup() (Bruce)
       This prevents a large number of "*.backup" files from existing in
       "/pg_xlog".
     * Add configuration parameters to control TCP/IP keep-alive times for
       idle, interval, and count (Oliver Jowett)
       These values can be changed to allow more rapid detection of lost
       client connections.
     * Add per-user and per-database connection limits (Petr Jelinek)
       Using "ALTER USER" and "ALTER DATABASE", limits can now be enforced
       on the maximum number of sessions that can concurrently connect as
       a specific user or to a specific database. Setting the limit to
       zero disables user or database connections.
     * Allow more than two gigabytes of shared memory and per-backend work
       memory on 64-bit machines (Koichi Suzuki)
     * New system catalog pg_pltemplate allows overriding obsolete
       procedural-language definitions in dump files (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Query Changes

     * Add temporary views (Koju Iijima, Neil)
     * Fix "HAVING" without any aggregate functions or "GROUP BY" so that
       the query returns a single group (Tom)
       Previously, such a case would treat the "HAVING" clause the same as
       a "WHERE" clause. This was not per spec.
     * Add "USING" clause to allow additional tables to be specified to
       "DELETE" (Euler Taveira de Oliveira, Neil)
       In prior releases, there was no clear method for specifying
       additional tables to be used for joins in a "DELETE" statement.
       "UPDATE" already has a FROM clause for this purpose.
     * Add support for \x hex escapes in backend and ecpg strings (Bruce)
       This is just like the standard C \x escape syntax. Octal escapes
       were already supported.
     * Add "BETWEEN SYMMETRIC" query syntax (Pavel Stehule)
       This feature allows "BETWEEN" comparisons without requiring the
       first value to be less than the second. For example, "2 BETWEEN
       [ASYMMETRIC] 3 AND 1" returns false, while "2 BETWEEN SYMMETRIC 3
       AND 1" returns true. "BETWEEN ASYMMETRIC" was already supported.
     * Add "NOWAIT" option to "SELECT ... FOR UPDATE/SHARE" (Hans-Juergen
       Schoenig)
       While the statement_timeout configuration parameter allows a query
       taking more than a certain amount of time to be cancelled, the
       "NOWAIT" option allows a query to be canceled as soon as a "SELECT
       ... FOR UPDATE/SHARE" command cannot immediately acquire a row
       lock.
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation Changes

     * Track dependencies of shared objects (Alvaro)
       PostgreSQL allows global tables (users, databases, tablespaces) to
       reference information in multiple databases. This addition adds
       dependency information for global tables, so, for example, user
       ownership can be tracked across databases, so a user who owns
       something in any database can no longer be removed. Dependency
       tracking already existed for database-local objects.
     * Allow limited "ALTER OWNER" commands to be performed by the object
       owner (Stephen Frost)
       Prior releases allowed only superusers to change object owners.
       Now, ownership can be transferred if the user executing the command
       owns the object and would be able to create it as the new owner
       (that is, the user is a member of the new owning role and that role
       has the CREATE permission that would be needed to create the object
       afresh).
     * Add "ALTER" object "SET SCHEMA" capability for some object types
       (tables, functions, types) (Bernd Helmle)
       This allows objects to be moved to different schemas.
     * Add "ALTER TABLE ENABLE/DISABLE TRIGGER" to disable triggers
       (Satoshi Nagayasu)
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Command Changes

     * Allow "TRUNCATE" to truncate multiple tables in a single command
       (Alvaro)
       Because of referential integrity checks, it is not allowed to
       truncate a table that is part of a referential integrity
       constraint. Using this new functionality, "TRUNCATE" can be used to
       truncate such tables, if both tables involved in a referential
       integrity constraint are truncated in a single "TRUNCATE" command.
     * Properly process carriage returns and line feeds in "COPY CSV" mode
       (Andrew)
       In release 8.0, carriage returns and line feeds in "CSV COPY TO"
       were processed in an inconsistent manner. (This was documented on
       the TODO list.)
     * Add "COPY WITH CSV HEADER" to allow a header line as the first line
       in "COPY" (Andrew)
       This allows handling of the common "CSV" usage of placing the
       column names on the first line of the data file. For "COPY TO", the
       first line contains the column names, and for "COPY FROM", the
       first line is ignored.
     * On Windows, display better sub-second precision in "EXPLAIN
       ANALYZE" (Magnus)
     * Add trigger duration display to "EXPLAIN ANALYZE" (Tom)
       Prior releases included trigger execution time as part of the total
       execution time, but did not show it separately. It is now possible
       to see how much time is spent in each trigger.
     * Add support for \x hex escapes in "COPY" (Sergey Ten)
       Previous releases only supported octal escapes.
     * Make "SHOW ALL" include variable descriptions (Matthias Schmidt)
       "SHOW" varname still only displays the variable's value and does
       not include the description.
     * Make initdb create a new standard database called postgres, and
       convert utilities to use postgres rather than template1 for
       standard lookups (Dave)
       In prior releases, template1 was used both as a default connection
       for utilities like createuser, and as a template for new databases.
       This caused "CREATE DATABASE" to sometimes fail, because a new
       database cannot be created if anyone else is in the template
       database. With this change, the default connection database is now
       postgres, meaning it is much less likely someone will be using
       template1 during "CREATE DATABASE".
     * Create new reindexdb command-line utility by moving
       "/contrib/reindexdb" into the server (Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Type and Function Changes

     * Add MAX() and MIN() aggregates for array types (Koju Iijima)
     * Fix to_date() and to_timestamp() to behave reasonably when CC and
       YY fields are both used (Karel Zak)
       If the format specification contains CC and a year specification is
       YYY or longer, ignore the CC. If the year specification is YY or
       shorter, interpret CC as the previous century.
     * Add md5(bytea) (Abhijit Menon-Sen)
       md5(text) already existed.
     * Add support for "numeric ^ numeric" based on power(numeric,
       numeric)
       The function already existed, but there was no operator assigned to
       it.
     * Fix NUMERIC modulus by properly truncating the quotient during
       computation (Bruce)
       In previous releases, modulus for large values sometimes returned
       negative results due to rounding of the quotient.
     * Add a function lastval() (Dennis Björklund)
       lastval() is a simplified version of currval(). It automatically
       determines the proper sequence name based on the most recent
       nextval() or setval() call performed by the current session.
     * Add to_timestamp(DOUBLE PRECISION) (Michael Glaesemann)
       Converts Unix seconds since 1970 to a TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE.
     * Add pg_postmaster_start_time() function (Euler Taveira de Oliveira,
       Matthias Schmidt)
     * Allow the full use of time zone names in "AT TIME ZONE", not just
       the short list previously available (Magnus)
       Previously, only a predefined list of time zone names were
       supported by "AT TIME ZONE". Now any supported time zone name can
       be used, e.g.:
         SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/London';

       In the above query, the time zone used is adjusted based on the
       daylight saving time rules that were in effect on the supplied
       date.
     * Add GREATEST() and LEAST() variadic functions (Pavel Stehule)
       These functions take a variable number of arguments and return the
       greatest or least value among the arguments.
     * Add pg_column_size() (Mark Kirkwood)
       This returns storage size of a column, which might be compressed.
     * Add regexp_replace() (Atsushi Ogawa)
       This allows regular expression replacement, like sed. An optional
       flag argument allows selection of global (replace all) and
       case-insensitive modes.
     * Fix interval division and multiplication (Bruce)
       Previous versions sometimes returned unjustified results, like "'4
       months'::interval / 5" returning "'1 mon -6 days'".
     * Fix roundoff behavior in timestamp, time, and interval output (Tom)
       This fixes some cases in which the seconds field would be shown as
       60 instead of incrementing the higher-order fields.
     * Add a separate day field to type interval so a one day interval can
       be distinguished from a 24 hour interval (Michael Glaesemann)
       Days that contain a daylight saving time adjustment are not 24
       hours long, but typically 23 or 25 hours. This change creates a
       conceptual distinction between intervals of "so many days" and
       intervals of "so many hours". Adding 1 day to a timestamp now gives
       the same local time on the next day even if a daylight saving time
       adjustment occurs between, whereas adding 24 hours will give a
       different local time when this happens. For example, under US DST
       rules:
         '2005-04-03 00:00:00-05' + '1 day' = '2005-04-04 00:00:00-04'
         '2005-04-03 00:00:00-05' + '24 hours' = '2005-04-04 01:00:00-04'

     * Add justify_days() and justify_hours() (Michael Glaesemann)
       These functions, respectively, adjust days to an appropriate number
       of full months and days, and adjust hours to an appropriate number
       of full days and hours.
     * Move "/contrib/dbsize" into the backend, and rename some of the
       functions (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
          + pg_tablespace_size()
          + pg_database_size()
          + pg_relation_size()
          + pg_total_relation_size()
          + pg_size_pretty()
       pg_total_relation_size() includes indexes and TOAST tables.
     * Add functions for read-only file access to the cluster directory
       (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
          + pg_stat_file()
          + pg_read_file()
          + pg_ls_dir()
     * Add pg_reload_conf() to force reloading of the configuration files
       (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
     * Add pg_rotate_logfile() to force rotation of the server log file
       (Dave Page, Andreas Pflug)
     * Change pg_stat_* views to include TOAST tables (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Encoding and Locale Changes

     * Rename some encodings to be more consistent and to follow
       international standards (Bruce)
          + UNICODE is now UTF8
          + ALT is now WIN866
          + WIN is now WIN1251
          + TCVN is now WIN1258
       The original names still work.
     * Add support for WIN1252 encoding (Roland Volkmann)
     * Add support for four-byte UTF8 characters (John Hansen)
       Previously only one, two, and three-byte UTF8 characters were
       supported. This is particularly important for support for some
       Chinese character sets.
     * Allow direct conversion between EUC_JP and SJIS to improve
       performance (Atsushi Ogawa)
     * Allow the UTF8 encoding to work on Windows (Magnus)
       This is done by mapping UTF8 to the Windows-native UTF16
       implementation.
     __________________________________________________________________

General Server-Side Language Changes

     * Fix "ALTER LANGUAGE RENAME" (Sergey Yatskevich)
     * Allow function characteristics, like strictness and volatility, to
       be modified via "ALTER FUNCTION" (Neil)
     * Increase the maximum number of function arguments to 100 (Tom)
     * Allow SQL and PL/PgSQL functions to use "OUT" and "INOUT"
       parameters (Tom)
       "OUT" is an alternate way for a function to return values. Instead
       of using "RETURN", values can be returned by assigning to
       parameters declared as "OUT" or "INOUT". This is notationally
       simpler in some cases, particularly so when multiple values need to
       be returned. While returning multiple values from a function was
       possible in previous releases, this greatly simplifies the process.
       (The feature will be extended to other server-side languages in
       future releases.)
     * Move language handler functions into the pg_catalog schema
       This makes it easier to drop the public schema if desired.
     * Add SPI_getnspname() to SPI (Neil)
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/PgSQL Server-Side Language Changes

     * Overhaul the memory management of PL/PgSQL functions (Neil)
       The parsetree of each function is now stored in a separate memory
       context. This allows this memory to be easily reclaimed when it is
       no longer needed.
     * Check function syntax at "CREATE FUNCTION" time, rather than at
       runtime (Neil)
       Previously, most syntax errors were reported only when the function
       was executed.
     * Allow "OPEN" to open non-"SELECT" queries like "EXPLAIN" and "SHOW"
       (Tom)
     * No longer require functions to issue a "RETURN" statement (Tom)
       This is a byproduct of the newly added "OUT" and "INOUT"
       functionality. "RETURN" can be omitted when it is not needed to
       provide the function's return value.
     * Add support for an optional "INTO" clause to PL/PgSQL's "EXECUTE"
       statement (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
     * Make "CREATE TABLE AS" set "ROW_COUNT" (Tom)
     * Define SQLSTATE and SQLERRM to return the SQLSTATE and error
       message of the current exception (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
       These variables are only defined inside exception blocks.
     * Allow the parameters to the "RAISE" statement to be expressions
       (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
     * Add a loop "CONTINUE" statement (Pavel Stehule, Neil)
     * Allow block and loop labels (Pavel Stehule)
     __________________________________________________________________

PL/Perl Server-Side Language Changes

     * Allow large result sets to be returned efficiently (Abhijit
       Menon-Sen)
       This allows functions to use return_next() to avoid building the
       entire result set in memory.
     * Allow one-row-at-a-time retrieval of query results (Abhijit
       Menon-Sen)
       This allows functions to use spi_query() and spi_fetchrow() to
       avoid accumulating the entire result set in memory.
     * Force PL/Perl to handle strings as UTF8 if the server encoding is
       UTF8 (David Kamholz)
     * Add a validator function for PL/Perl (Andrew)
       This allows syntax errors to be reported at definition time, rather
       than execution time.
     * Allow PL/Perl to return a Perl array when the function returns an
       array type (Andrew)
       This basically maps PostgreSQL arrays to Perl arrays.
     * Allow Perl nonfatal warnings to generate "NOTICE" messages (Andrew)
     * Allow Perl's strict mode to be enabled (Andrew)
     __________________________________________________________________

psql Changes

     * Add "\set ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK" to allow statements in a transaction
       to error without affecting the rest of the transaction (Greg Sabino
       Mullane)
       This is basically implemented by wrapping every statement in a
       sub-transaction.
     * Add support for \x hex strings in psql variables (Bruce)
       Octal escapes were already supported.
     * Add support for "troff -ms" output format (Roger Leigh)
     * Allow the history file location to be controlled by HISTFILE
       (Andreas Seltenreich)
       This allows configuration of per-database history storage.
     * Prevent "\x" (expanded mode) from affecting the output of "\d
       tablename" (Neil)
     * Add "-L" option to psql to log sessions (Lorne Sunley)
       This option was added because some operating systems do not have
       simple command-line activity logging functionality.
     * Make "\d" show the tablespaces of indexes (Qingqing Zhou)
     * Allow psql help ("\h") to make a best guess on the proper help
       information (Greg Sabino Mullane)
       This allows the user to just add "\h" to the front of the syntax
       error query and get help on the supported syntax. Previously any
       additional query text beyond the command name had to be removed to
       use "\h".
     * Add "\pset numericlocale" to allow numbers to be output in a
       locale-aware format (Eugen Nedelcu)
       For example, using C locale 100000 would be output as 100,000.0
       while a European locale might output this value as 100.000,0.
     * Make startup banner show both server version number and psql's
       version number, when they are different (Bruce)
       Also, a warning will be shown if the server and psql are from
       different major releases.
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump Changes

     * Add "-n" / "--schema" switch to pg_restore (Richard van den Berg)
       This allows just the objects in a specified schema to be restored.
     * Allow pg_dump to dump large objects even in text mode (Tom)
       With this change, large objects are now always dumped; the former
       "-b" switch is a no-op.
     * Allow pg_dump to dump a consistent snapshot of large objects (Tom)
     * Dump comments for large objects (Tom)
     * Add "--encoding" to pg_dump (Magnus Hagander)
       This allows a database to be dumped in an encoding that is
       different from the server's encoding. This is valuable when
       transferring the dump to a machine with a different encoding.
     * Rely on pg_pltemplate for procedural languages (Tom)
       If the call handler for a procedural language is in the pg_catalog
       schema, pg_dump does not dump the handler. Instead, it dumps the
       language using just "CREATE LANGUAGE name", relying on the
       pg_pltemplate catalog to provide the language's creation parameters
       at load time.
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq Changes

     * Add a PGPASSFILE environment variable to specify the password
       file's filename (Andrew)
     * Add lo_create(), that is similar to lo_creat() but allows the OID
       of the large object to be specified (Tom)
     * Make libpq consistently return an error to the client application
       on malloc() failure (Neil)
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code Changes

     * Fix pgxs to support building against a relocated installation
     * Add spinlock support for the Itanium processor using Intel compiler
       (Vikram Kalsi)
     * Add Kerberos 5 support for Windows (Magnus)
     * Add Chinese FAQ (laser@pgsqldb.com)
     * Rename Rendezvous to Bonjour to match OS/X feature renaming (Bruce)
     * Add support for fsync_writethrough on Darwin (Chris Campbell)
     * Streamline the passing of information within the server, the
       optimizer, and the lock system (Tom)
     * Allow pg_config to be compiled using MSVC (Andrew)
       This is required to build DBD::Pg using MSVC.
     * Remove support for Kerberos V4 (Magnus)
       Kerberos 4 had security vulnerabilities and is no longer
       maintained.
     * Code cleanups (Coverity static analysis performed by EnterpriseDB)
     * Modify "postgresql.conf" to use documentation defaults on/off
       rather than true/false (Bruce)
     * Enhance pg_config to be able to report more build-time values (Tom)
     * Allow libpq to be built thread-safe on Windows (Dave Page)
     * Allow IPv6 connections to be used on Windows (Andrew)
     * Add Server Administration documentation about I/O subsystem
       reliability (Bruce)
     * Move private declarations from "gist.h" to "gist_private.h" (Neil)
       In previous releases, "gist.h" contained both the public GiST API
       (intended for use by authors of GiST index implementations) as well
       as some private declarations used by the implementation of GiST
       itself. The latter have been moved to a separate file,
       "gist_private.h". Most GiST index implementations should be
       unaffected.
     * Overhaul GiST memory management (Neil)
       GiST methods are now always invoked in a short-lived memory
       context. Therefore, memory allocated via palloc() will be reclaimed
       automatically, so GiST index implementations do not need to
       manually release allocated memory via pfree().
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib Changes

     * Add "/contrib/pg_buffercache" contrib module (Mark Kirkwood)
       This displays the contents of the buffer cache, for debugging and
       performance tuning purposes.
     * Remove "/contrib/array" because it is obsolete (Tom)
     * Clean up the "/contrib/lo" module (Tom)
     * Move "/contrib/findoidjoins" to "/src/tools" (Tom)
     * Remove the <<, >>, &<, and &> operators from "/contrib/cube"
       These operators were not useful.
     * Improve "/contrib/btree_gist" (Janko Richter)
     * Improve "/contrib/pgbench" (Tomoaki Sato, Tatsuo)
       There is now a facility for testing with SQL command scripts given
       by the user, instead of only a hard-wired command sequence.
     * Improve "/contrib/pgcrypto" (Marko Kreen)
          + Implementation of OpenPGP symmetric-key and public-key
            encryption
            Both RSA and Elgamal public-key algorithms are supported.
          + Stand alone build: include SHA256/384/512 hashes, Fortuna PRNG
          + OpenSSL build: support 3DES, use internal AES with OpenSSL <
            0.9.7
          + Take build parameters (OpenSSL, zlib) from "configure" result
            There is no need to edit the "Makefile" anymore.
          + Remove support for "libmhash" and "libmcrypt"

                                Release 8.0.8

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.7, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 may require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       may require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote is
       in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations and standard_conforming_strings
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also
       future-proofs them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard
       string literal syntax. Applications that use multiple PostgreSQL
       connections concurrently should migrate to PQescapeStringConn() and
       PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that escaping is done correctly for
       the settings in use in each database connection. Applications that
       do string escaping "by hand" should be modified to rely on library
       routines instead.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, alt_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Fix bug that sometimes caused OR'd index scans to miss rows they
       should have returned
     * Fix WAL replay for case where a btree index has been truncated
     * Fix SIMILAR TO for patterns involving | (Tom)
     * Fix "SELECT INTO" and "CREATE TABLE AS" to create tables in the
       default tablespace, not the base directory (Kris Jurka)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Fix for Bonjour on Intel Macs (Ashley Clark)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks
     * Fix problem with password prompting on some Win32 systems (Robert
       Kinberg)

                                Release 8.0.7

     Release date: 2006-02-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.6, see the release notes
   for 8.0.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix potential crash in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" (CVE-2006-0553)
       An unprivileged user could crash the server process, resulting in
       momentary denial of service to other users, if the server has been
       compiled with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to
       Akio Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 8.0.4, 7.4.9, and 7.3.11 releases.
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog and pg_subtrans file creation (Tom)
     * Fix cases that could lead to crashes if a cache-invalidation
       message arrives at just the wrong time (Tom)
     * Properly check DOMAIN constraints for UNKNOWN parameters in
       prepared statements (Neil)
     * Ensure "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" will process FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and
       PRIMARY KEY constraints in the proper order (Nakano Yoshihisa)
     * Fixes to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators or operator classes (Tom)
     * Allow pg_restore to continue properly after a "COPY" failure;
       formerly it tried to treat the remaining "COPY" data as SQL
       commands (Stephen Frost)
     * Fix pg_ctl unregister crash when the data directory is not
       specified (Magnus)
     * Fix ecpg crash on AMD64 and PPC (Neil)
     * Recover properly if error occurs during argument passing in
       PL/python (Neil)
     * Fix PL/perl's handling of locales on Win32 to match the backend
       (Andrew)
     * Fix crash when log_min_messages is set to DEBUG3 or above in
       "postgresql.conf" on Win32 (Bruce)
     * Fix pgxs -L library path specification for Win32, Cygwin, OS X, AIX
       (Bruce)
     * Check that SID is enabled while checking for Win32 admin privileges
       (Magnus)
     * Properly reject out-of-range date inputs (Kris Jurka)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.6

     Release date: 2006-01-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.3, see the release notes
   for 8.0.3. Also, you might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns
   after updating, if you are affected by the locale or plperl issues
   described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix Windows code so that postmaster will continue rather than exit
       if there is no more room in ShmemBackendArray (Magnus)
       The previous behavior could lead to a denial-of-service situation
       if too many connection requests arrive close together. This applies
       *only* to the Windows port.
     * Fix bug introduced in 8.0 that could allow ReadBuffer to return an
       already-used page as new, potentially causing loss of
       recently-committed data (Tom)
     * Fix for protocol-level Describe messages issued outside a
       transaction or in a failed transaction (Tom)
     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You may need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Allow more flexible relocation of installation directories (Tom)
       Previous releases supported relocation only if all installation
       directory paths were the same except for the last component.
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Various fixes for functions returning RECORDs (Tom)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.5

     Release date: 2005-12-12

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.3, see the release notes
   for 8.0.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix race condition in transaction log management
       There was a narrow window in which an I/O operation could be
       initiated for the wrong page, leading to an Assert failure or data
       corruption.
     * Fix bgwriter problems after recovering from errors (Tom)
       The background writer was found to leak buffer pins after write
       errors. While not fatal in itself, this might lead to mysterious
       blockages of later VACUUM commands.
     * Prevent failure if client sends Bind protocol message when current
       transaction is already aborted
     * "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * AIX and HPUX compile fixes (Tom)
     * Retry file reads and writes after Windows NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES error
       (Qingqing Zhou)
     * Fix intermittent failure when log_line_prefix includes %i
     * Fix psql performance issue with long scripts on Windows (Merlin
       Moncure)
     * Fix missing updates of "pg_group" flat file
     * Fix longstanding planning error for outer joins
       This bug sometimes caused a bogus error "RIGHT JOIN is only
       supported with merge-joinable join conditions".
     * Postpone timezone initialization until after "postmaster.pid" is
       created
       This avoids confusing startup scripts that expect the pid file to
       appear quickly.
     * Prevent core dump in pg_autovacuum when a table has been dropped
     * Fix problems with whole-row references (foo.*) to subquery results
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.4

     Release date: 2005-10-04

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.0.3, see the release notes
   for 8.0.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix error that allowed "VACUUM" to remove ctid chains too soon, and
       add more checking in code that follows ctid links
       This fixes a long-standing problem that could cause crashes in very
       rare circumstances.
     * Fix CHAR() to properly pad spaces to the specified length when
       using a multiple-byte character set (Yoshiyuki Asaba)
       In prior releases, the padding of CHAR() was incorrect because it
       only padded to the specified number of bytes without considering
       how many characters were stored.
     * Force a checkpoint before committing "CREATE DATABASE"
       This should fix recent reports of "index is not a btree" failures
       when a crash occurs shortly after "CREATE DATABASE".
     * Fix the sense of the test for read-only transaction in "COPY"
       The code formerly prohibited "COPY TO", where it should prohibit
       "COPY FROM".
     * Handle consecutive embedded newlines in "COPY" CSV-mode input
     * Fix date_trunc(week) for dates near year end
     * Fix planning problem with outer-join ON clauses that reference only
       the inner-side relation
     * Further fixes for x FULL JOIN y ON true corner cases
     * Fix overenthusiastic optimization of x IN (SELECT DISTINCT ...) and
       related cases
     * Fix mis-planning of queries with small LIMIT values due to poorly
       thought out "fuzzy" cost comparison
     * Make array_in and array_recv more paranoid about validating their
       OID parameter
     * Fix missing rows in queries like UPDATE a=... WHERE a... with GiST
       index on column a
     * Improve robustness of datetime parsing
     * Improve checking for partially-written WAL pages
     * Improve robustness of signal handling when SSL is enabled
     * Improve MIPS and M68K spinlock code
     * Don't try to open more than max_files_per_process files during
       postmaster startup
     * Various memory leakage fixes
     * Various portability improvements
     * Update timezone data files
     * Improve handling of DLL load failures on Windows
     * Improve random-number generation on Windows
     * Make psql -f filename return a nonzero exit code when opening the
       file fails
     * Change pg_dump to handle inherited check constraints more reliably
     * Fix password prompting in pg_restore on Windows
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to handle var := var correctly when the variable is of
       pass-by-reference type
     * Fix PL/Perl %_SHARED so it's actually shared
     * Fix "contrib/pg_autovacuum" to allow sleep intervals over 2000 sec
     * Update "contrib/tsearch2" to use current Snowball code
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.3

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.2, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.3

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.X. However, it is
   one possible way of handling two significant security problems that
   have been found in the initial contents of 8.0.X system catalogs. A
   dump/initdb/reload sequence using 8.0.3's initdb will automatically
   correct these problems.

   The larger security problem is that the built-in character set encoding
   conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged
   users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not
   secure against malicious choices of arguments. The fix involves
   changing the declared parameter list of these functions so that they
   can no longer be invoked from SQL commands. (This does not affect their
   normal use by the encoding conversion machinery.)

   The lesser problem is that the "contrib/tsearch2" module creates
   several functions that are improperly declared to return internal when
   they do not accept internal arguments. This breaks type safety for all
   functions using internal arguments.

   It is strongly recommended that all installations repair these errors,
   either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedure given
   below. The errors at least allow unprivileged database users to crash
   their server process, and may allow unprivileged users to gain the
   privileges of a database superuser.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the same manual repair
   procedures shown in the 7.4.8 release notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change encoding function signature to prevent misuse
     * Change "contrib/tsearch2" to avoid unsafe use of INTERNAL function
       results
     * Guard against incorrect second parameter to record_out
     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix comparisons of TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
       The comparison code was wrong in the case where the
       --enable-integer-datetimes configuration switch had been used.
       NOTE: if you have an index on a TIME WITH TIME ZONE column, it will
       need to be "REINDEX"ed after installing this update, because the
       fix corrects the sort order of column values.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Fix mis-display of negative fractional seconds in INTERVAL values
       This error only occurred when the --enable-integer-datetimes
       configuration switch had been used.
     * Fix pg_dump to dump trigger names containing % correctly (Neil)
     * Still more 64-bit fixes for "contrib/intagg"
     * Prevent incorrect optimization of functions returning RECORD
     * Prevent crash on COALESCE(NULL,NULL)
     * Fix Borland makefile for libpq
     * Fix "contrib/btree_gist" for timetz type (Teodor)
     * Make "pg_ctl" check the PID found in "postmaster.pid" to see if it
       is still a live process
     * Fix "pg_dump"/"pg_restore" problems caused by addition of dump
       timestamps
     * Fix interaction between materializing holdable cursors and firing
       deferred triggers during transaction commit
     * Fix memory leak in SQL functions returning pass-by-reference data
       types

                                Release 8.0.2

     Release date: 2005-04-07

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.*. This release
   updates the major version number of the PostgreSQL libraries, so it
   might be necessary to re-link some user applications if they cannot
   find the properly-numbered shared library.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Increment the major version number of all interface libraries
       (Bruce)
       This should have been done in 8.0.0. It is required so 7.4.X
       versions of PostgreSQL client applications, like psql, can be used
       on the same machine as 8.0.X applications. This might require
       re-linking user applications that use these libraries.
     * Add Windows-only wal_sync_method setting of "fsync_writethrough"
       (Magnus, Bruce)
       This setting causes PostgreSQL to write through any disk-drive
       write cache when writing to WAL. This behavior was formerly called
       "fsync", but was renamed because it acts quite differently from
       "fsync" on other platforms.
     * Enable the wal_sync_method setting of "open_datasync" on Windows,
       and make it the default for that platform (Magnus, Bruce)
       Because the default is no longer "fsync_writethrough", data loss is
       possible during a power failure if the disk drive has write caching
       enabled. To turn off the write cache on Windows, from the Device
       Manager, choose the drive properties, then Policies.
     * New cache management algorithm 2Q replaces ARC (Tom)
       This was done to avoid a pending US patent on ARC. The 2Q code
       might be a few percentage points slower than ARC for some work
       loads. A better cache management algorithm will appear in 8.1.
     * Planner adjustments to improve behavior on freshly-created tables
       (Tom)
     * Allow plpgsql to assign to an element of an array that is initially
       NULL (Tom)
       Formerly the array would remain NULL, but now it becomes a
       single-element array. The main SQL engine was changed to handle
       "UPDATE" of a null array value this way in 8.0, but the similar
       case in plpgsql was overlooked.
     * Convert \r\n and \r to \n in plpython function bodies (Michael
       Fuhr)
       This prevents syntax errors when plpython code is written on a
       Windows or Mac client.
     * Allow SPI cursors to handle utility commands that return rows, such
       as "EXPLAIN" (Tom)
     * Fix "CLUSTER" failure after "ALTER TABLE SET WITHOUT OIDS" (Tom)
     * Reduce memory usage of "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN" (Neil)
     * Fix "ALTER LANGUAGE RENAME" (Tom)
     * Document the Windows-only register and unregister options of pg_ctl
       (Magnus)
     * Ensure operations done during backend shutdown are counted by
       statistics collector
       This is expected to resolve reports of pg_autovacuum not vacuuming
       the system catalogs often enough -- it was not being told about
       catalog deletions caused by temporary table removal during backend
       exit.
     * Change the Windows default for configuration parameter
       log_destination to "eventlog" (Magnus)
       By default, a server running on Windows will now send log output to
       the Windows event logger rather than standard error.
     * Make Kerberos authentication work on Windows (Magnus)
     * Allow "ALTER DATABASE RENAME" by superusers who aren't flagged as
       having CREATEDB privilege (Tom)
     * Modify WAL log entries for "CREATE" and "DROP DATABASE" to not
       specify absolute paths (Tom)
       This allows point-in-time recovery on a different machine with
       possibly different database location. Note that "CREATE TABLESPACE"
       still poses a hazard in such situations.
     * Fix crash from a backend exiting with an open transaction that
       created a table and opened a cursor on it (Tom)
     * Fix array_map() so it can call PL functions (Tom)
     * Several "contrib/tsearch2" and "contrib/btree_gist" fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix crash of some "contrib/pgcrypto" functions on some platforms
       (Marko Kreen)
     * Fix "contrib/intagg" for 64-bit platforms (Tom)
     * Fix ecpg bugs in parsing of "CREATE" statement (Michael)
     * Work around gcc bug on powerpc and amd64 causing problems in ecpg
       (Christof Petig)
     * Do not use locale-aware versions of upper(), lower(), and initcap()
       when the locale is C (Bruce)
       This allows these functions to work on platforms that generate
       errors for non-7-bit data when the locale is C.
     * Fix quote_ident() to quote names that match keywords (Tom)
     * Fix to_date() to behave reasonably when CC and YY fields are both
       used (Karel)
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from failing when given a zero-month
       interval (Tom)
     * Fix wrong week returned by date_trunc('week') (Bruce)
       date_trunc('week') returned the wrong year for the first few days
       of January in some years.
     * Use the correct default mask length for class D addresses in INET
       data types (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 8.0.1

     Release date: 2005-01-31

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.0.0, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0.1

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.0.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Check that creator of an aggregate function has the right to
       execute the specified transition functions
       This oversight made it possible to bypass denial of EXECUTE
       permission on a function.
     * Fix security and 64-bit issues in contrib/intagg
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Make "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN" enforce domain constraints in all
       cases
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Improve planning of grouped aggregate queries
     * "ROLLBACK TO savepoint" closes cursors created since the savepoint
     * Fix inadequate backend stack size on Windows
     * Avoid SHGetSpecialFolderPath() on Windows (Magnus)
     * Fix some problems in running pg_autovacuum as a Windows service
       (Dave Page)
     * Multiple minor bug fixes in pg_dump/pg_restore
     * Fix ecpg segfault with named structs used in typedefs (Michael)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Release 8.0

     Release date: 2005-01-19
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   Microsoft Windows Native Server
          This is the first PostgreSQL release to run natively on
          Microsoft Windows® as a server. It can run as a Windows service.
          This release supports NT-based Windows releases like Windows
          2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003. Older releases like Windows
          95, Windows 98, and Windows ME are not supported because these
          operating systems do not have the infrastructure to support
          PostgreSQL. A separate installer project has been created to
          ease installation on Windows -- see
          http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/win32/.

          Although tested throughout our release cycle, the Windows port
          does not have the benefit of years of use in production
          environments that PostgreSQL has on Unix platforms. Therefore it
          should be treated with the same level of caution as you would a
          new product.

          Previous releases required the Unix emulation toolkit Cygwin in
          order to run the server on Windows operating systems. PostgreSQL
          has supported native clients on Windows for many years.

   Savepoints
          Savepoints allow specific parts of a transaction to be aborted
          without affecting the remainder of the transaction. Prior
          releases had no such capability; there was no way to recover
          from a statement failure within a transaction except by aborting
          the whole transaction. This feature is valuable for application
          writers who require error recovery within a complex transaction.

   Point-In-Time Recovery
          In previous releases there was no way to recover from disk drive
          failure except to restore from a previous backup or use a
          standby replication server. Point-in-time recovery allows
          continuous backup of the server. You can recover either to the
          point of failure or to some transaction in the past.

   Tablespaces
          Tablespaces allow administrators to select different file
          systems for storage of individual tables, indexes, and
          databases. This improves performance and control over disk space
          usage. Prior releases used initlocation and manual symlink
          management for such tasks.

   Improved Buffer Management, CHECKPOINT, VACUUM
          This release has a more intelligent buffer replacement strategy,
          which will make better use of available shared buffers and
          improve performance. The performance impact of vacuum and
          checkpoints is also lessened.

   Change Column Types
          A column's data type can now be changed with "ALTER TABLE".

   New Perl Server-Side Language
          A new version of the plperl server-side language now supports a
          persistent shared storage area, triggers, returning records and
          arrays of records, and SPI calls to access the database.

   Comma-separated-value (CSV) support in COPY
          "COPY" can now read and write comma-separated-value files. It
          has the flexibility to interpret nonstandard quoting and
          separation characters too.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 8.0

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * In "READ COMMITTED" serialization mode, volatile functions now see
       the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the
       beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to
       the beginning of the interactive command that called the function.
     * Functions declared "STABLE" or "IMMUTABLE" always use the snapshot
       of the calling query, and therefore do not see the effects of
       actions taken after the calling query starts, whether in their own
       transaction or other transactions. Such a function must be
       read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other
       than "SELECT".
     * Nondeferred "AFTER" triggers are now fired immediately after
       completion of the triggering query, rather than upon finishing the
       current interactive command. This makes a difference when the
       triggering query occurred within a function: the trigger is invoked
       before the function proceeds to its next operation.
     * Server configuration parameters virtual_host and tcpip_socket have
       been replaced with a more general parameter listen_addresses. Also,
       the server now listens on localhost by default, which eliminates
       the need for the -i postmaster switch in many scenarios.
     * Server configuration parameters SortMem and VacuumMem have been
       renamed to work_mem and maintenance_work_mem to better reflect
       their use. The original names are still supported in "SET" and
       "SHOW".
     * Server configuration parameters log_pid, log_timestamp, and
       log_source_port have been replaced with a more general parameter
       log_line_prefix.
     * Server configuration parameter syslog has been replaced with a more
       logical log_destination variable to control the log output
       destination.
     * Server configuration parameter log_statement has been changed so it
       can selectively log just database modification or data definition
       statements. Server configuration parameter log_duration now prints
       only when log_statement prints the query.
     * Server configuration parameter max_expr_depth parameter has been
       replaced with max_stack_depth which measures the physical stack
       size rather than the expression nesting depth. This helps prevent
       session termination due to stack overflow caused by recursive
       functions.
     * The length() function no longer counts trailing spaces in CHAR(n)
       values.
     * Casting an integer to BIT(N) selects the rightmost N bits of the
       integer, not the leftmost N bits as before.
     * Updating an element or slice of a NULL array value now produces a
       nonnull array result, namely an array containing just the
       assigned-to positions.
     * Syntax checking of array input values has been tightened up
       considerably. Junk that was previously allowed in odd places with
       odd results now causes an error. Empty-string element values must
       now be written as "", rather than writing nothing. Also changed
       behavior with respect to whitespace surrounding array elements:
       trailing whitespace is now ignored, for symmetry with leading
       whitespace (which has always been ignored).
     * Overflow in integer arithmetic operations is now detected and
       reported as an error.
     * The arithmetic operators associated with the single-byte "char"
       data type have been removed.
     * The extract() function (also called date_part) now returns the
       proper year for BC dates. It previously returned one less than the
       correct year. The function now also returns the proper values for
       millennium and century.
     * CIDR values now must have their nonmasked bits be zero. For
       example, we no longer allow 204.248.199.1/31 as a CIDR value. Such
       values should never have been accepted by PostgreSQL and will now
       be rejected.
     * "EXECUTE" now returns a completion tag that matches the executed
       statement.
     * psql's "\copy" command now reads or writes to the query's
       stdin/stdout, rather than psql's stdin/stdout. The previous
       behavior can be accessed via new "pstdin"/"pstdout" parameters.
     * The JDBC client interface has been removed from the core
       distribution, and is now hosted at http://jdbc.postgresql.org.
     * The Tcl client interface has also been removed. There are several
       Tcl interfaces now hosted at http://gborg.postgresql.org.
     * The server now uses its own time zone database, rather than the one
       supplied by the operating system. This will provide consistent
       behavior across all platforms. In most cases, there should be
       little noticeable difference in time zone behavior, except that the
       time zone names used by "SET"/"SHOW" TimeZone may be different from
       what your platform provides.
     * Configure's threading option no longer requires users to run tests
       or edit configuration files; threading options are now detected
       automatically.
     * Now that tablespaces have been implemented, initlocation has been
       removed.
     * The API for user-defined GiST indexes has been changed. The Union
       and PickSplit methods are now passed a pointer to a special
       GistEntryVector structure, rather than a bytea.
     __________________________________________________________________

Deprecated Features

   Some aspects of PostgreSQL's behavior have been determined to be
   suboptimal. For the sake of backward compatibility these have not been
   removed in 8.0, but they are considered deprecated and will be removed
   in the next major release.

     * The 8.1 release will remove the to_char() function for intervals.
     * The server now warns of empty strings passed to oid/float4/float8
       data types, but continues to interpret them as zeroes as before. In
       the next major release, empty strings will be considered invalid
       input for these data types.
     * By default, tables in PostgreSQL 8.0 and earlier are created with
       OIDs. In the next release, this will *not* be the case: to create a
       table that contains OIDs, the "WITH OIDS" clause must be specified
       or the default_with_oids configuration parameter must be set. Users
       are encouraged to explicitly specify "WITH OIDS" if their tables
       require OIDs for compatibility with future releases of PostgreSQL.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the changes between release
   8.0 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance Improvements

     * Support cross-data-type index usage (Tom)
       Before this change, many queries would not use an index if the data
       types did not match exactly. This improvement makes index usage
       more intuitive and consistent.
     * New buffer replacement strategy that improves caching (Jan)
       Prior releases used a least-recently-used (LRU) cache to keep
       recently referenced pages in memory. The LRU algorithm did not
       consider the number of times a specific cache entry was accessed,
       so large table scans could force out useful cache pages. The new
       cache algorithm uses four separate lists to track most recently
       used and most frequently used cache pages and dynamically optimize
       their replacement based on the work load. This should lead to much
       more efficient use of the shared buffer cache. Administrators who
       have tested shared buffer sizes in the past should retest with this
       new cache replacement policy.
     * Add subprocess to write dirty buffers periodically to reduce
       checkpoint writes (Jan)
       In previous releases, the checkpoint process, which runs every few
       minutes, would write all dirty buffers to the operating system's
       buffer cache then flush all dirty operating system buffers to disk.
       This resulted in a periodic spike in disk usage that often hurt
       performance. The new code uses a background writer to trickle disk
       writes at a steady pace so checkpoints have far fewer dirty pages
       to write to disk. Also, the new code does not issue a global sync()
       call, but instead fsync()s just the files written since the last
       checkpoint. This should improve performance and minimize
       degradation during checkpoints.
     * Add ability to prolong vacuum to reduce performance impact (Jan)
       On busy systems, "VACUUM" performs many I/O requests which can hurt
       performance for other users. This release allows you to slow down
       "VACUUM" to reduce its impact on other users, though this increases
       the total duration of "VACUUM".
     * Improve B-tree index performance for duplicate keys (Dmitry Tkach,
       Tom)
       This improves the way indexes are scanned when many duplicate
       values exist in the index.
     * Use dynamically-generated table size estimates while planning (Tom)
       Formerly the planner estimated table sizes using the values seen by
       the last "VACUUM" or "ANALYZE", both as to physical table size
       (number of pages) and number of rows. Now, the current physical
       table size is obtained from the kernel, and the number of rows is
       estimated by multiplying the table size by the row density (rows
       per page) seen by the last "VACUUM" or "ANALYZE". This should
       produce more reliable estimates in cases where the table size has
       changed significantly since the last housekeeping command.
     * Improved index usage with OR clauses (Tom)
       This allows the optimizer to use indexes in statements with many OR
       clauses that would not have been indexed in the past. It can also
       use multi-column indexes where the first column is specified and
       the second column is part of an OR clause.
     * Improve matching of partial index clauses (Tom)
       The server is now smarter about using partial indexes in queries
       involving complex "WHERE" clauses.
     * Improve performance of the GEQO optimizer (Tom)
       The GEQO optimizer is used to plan queries involving many tables
       (by default, twelve or more). This release speeds up the way
       queries are analyzed to decrease time spent in optimization.
     * Miscellaneous optimizer improvements
       There is not room here to list all the minor improvements made, but
       numerous special cases work better than in prior releases.
     * Improve lookup speed for C functions (Tom)
       This release uses a hash table to lookup information for
       dynamically loaded C functions. This improves their speed so they
       perform nearly as quickly as functions that are built into the
       server executable.
     * Add type-specific "ANALYZE" statistics capability (Mark
       Cave-Ayland)
       This feature allows more flexibility in generating statistics for
       nonstandard data types.
     * "ANALYZE" now collects statistics for expression indexes (Tom)
       Expression indexes (also called functional indexes) allow users to
       index not just columns but the results of expressions and function
       calls. With this release, the optimizer can gather and use
       statistics about the contents of expression indexes. This will
       greatly improve the quality of planning for queries in which an
       expression index is relevant.
     * New two-stage sampling method for "ANALYZE" (Manfred Koizar)
       This gives better statistics when the density of valid rows is very
       different in different regions of a table.
     * Speed up "TRUNCATE" (Tom)
       This buys back some of the performance loss observed in 7.4, while
       still keeping "TRUNCATE" transaction-safe.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Changes

     * Add WAL file archiving and point-in-time recovery (Simon Riggs)
     * Add tablespaces so admins can control disk layout (Gavin)
     * Add a built-in log rotation program (Andreas Pflug)
       It is now possible to log server messages conveniently without
       relying on either syslog or an external log rotation program.
     * Add new read-only server configuration parameters to show server
       compile-time settings: block_size, integer_datetimes,
       max_function_args, max_identifier_length, max_index_keys (Joe)
     * Make quoting of sameuser, samegroup, and all remove special meaning
       of these terms in "pg_hba.conf" (Andrew)
     * Use clearer IPv6 name ::1/128 for localhost in default
       "pg_hba.conf" (Andrew)
     * Use CIDR format in "pg_hba.conf" examples (Andrew)
     * Rename server configuration parameters SortMem and VacuumMem to
       work_mem and maintenance_work_mem (Old names still supported) (Tom)
       This change was made to clarify that bulk operations such as index
       and foreign key creation use maintenance_work_mem, while work_mem
       is for workspaces used during query execution.
     * Allow logging of session disconnections using server configuration
       log_disconnections (Andrew)
     * Add new server configuration parameter log_line_prefix to allow
       control of information emitted in each log line (Andrew)
       Available information includes user name, database name, remote IP
       address, and session start time.
     * Remove server configuration parameters log_pid, log_timestamp,
       log_source_port; functionality superseded by log_line_prefix
       (Andrew)
     * Replace the virtual_host and tcpip_socket parameters with a unified
       listen_addresses parameter (Andrew, Tom)
       virtual_host could only specify a single IP address to listen on.
       listen_addresses allows multiple addresses to be specified.
     * Listen on localhost by default, which eliminates the need for the
       "-i" postmaster switch in many scenarios (Andrew)
       Listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) opens no new security holes but
       allows configurations like Windows and JDBC, which do not support
       local sockets, to work without special adjustments.
     * Remove syslog server configuration parameter, and add more logical
       log_destination variable to control log output location (Magnus)
     * Change server configuration parameter log_statement to take values
       all, mod, ddl, or none to select which queries are logged (Bruce)
       This allows administrators to log only data definition changes or
       only data modification statements.
     * Some logging-related configuration parameters could formerly be
       adjusted by ordinary users, but only in the "more verbose"
       direction. They are now treated more strictly: only superusers can
       set them. However, a superuser may use "ALTER USER" to provide
       per-user settings of these values for non-superusers. Also, it is
       now possible for superusers to set values of superuser-only
       configuration parameters via PGOPTIONS.
     * Allow configuration files to be placed outside the data directory
       (mlw)
       By default, configuration files are kept in the cluster's top
       directory. With this addition, configuration files can be placed
       outside the data directory, easing administration.
     * Plan prepared queries only when first executed so constants can be
       used for statistics (Oliver Jowett)
       Prepared statements plan queries once and execute them many times.
       While prepared queries avoid the overhead of re-planning on each
       use, the quality of the plan suffers from not knowing the exact
       parameters to be used in the query. In this release, planning of
       unnamed prepared statements is delayed until the first execution,
       and the actual parameter values of that execution are used as
       optimization hints. This allows use of out-of-line parameter
       passing without incurring a performance penalty.
     * Allow "DECLARE CURSOR" to take parameters (Oliver Jowett)
       It is now useful to issue "DECLARE CURSOR" in a Parse message with
       parameters. The parameter values sent at Bind time will be
       substituted into the execution of the cursor's query.
     * Fix hash joins and aggregates of inet and cidr data types (Tom)
       Release 7.4 handled hashing of mixed inet and cidr values
       incorrectly. (This bug did not exist in prior releases because they
       wouldn't try to hash either data type.)
     * Make log_duration print only when log_statement prints the query
       (Ed L.)
     __________________________________________________________________

Query Changes

     * Add savepoints (nested transactions) (Alvaro)
     * Unsupported isolation levels are now accepted and promoted to the
       nearest supported level (Peter)
       The SQL specification states that if a database doesn't support a
       specific isolation level, it should use the next more restrictive
       level. This change complies with that recommendation.
     * Allow "BEGIN WORK" to specify transaction isolation levels like
       "START TRANSACTION" does (Bruce)
     * Fix table permission checking for cases in which rules generate a
       query type different from the originally submitted query (Tom)
     * Implement dollar quoting to simplify single-quote usage (Andrew,
       Tom, David Fetter)
       In previous releases, because single quotes had to be used to quote
       a function's body, the use of single quotes inside the function
       text required use of two single quotes or other error-prone
       notations. With this release we add the ability to use "dollar
       quoting" to quote a block of text. The ability to use different
       quoting delimiters at different nesting levels greatly simplifies
       the task of quoting correctly, especially in complex functions.
       Dollar quoting can be used anywhere quoted text is needed.
     * Make CASE val WHEN compval1 THEN ... evaluate val only once (Tom)
       "CASE" no longer evaluates the tested expression multiple times.
       This has benefits when the expression is complex or is volatile.
     * Test "HAVING" before computing target list of an aggregate query
       (Tom)
       Fixes improper failure of cases such as SELECT SUM(win)/SUM(lose)
       ... GROUP BY ... HAVING SUM(lose) > 0. This should work but
       formerly could fail with divide-by-zero.
     * Replace max_expr_depth parameter with max_stack_depth parameter,
       measured in kilobytes of stack size (Tom)
       This gives us a fairly bulletproof defense against crashing due to
       runaway recursive functions. Instead of measuring the depth of
       expression nesting, we now directly measure the size of the
       execution stack.
     * Allow arbitrary row expressions (Tom)
       This release allows SQL expressions to contain arbitrary composite
       types, that is, row values. It also allows functions to more easily
       take rows as arguments and return row values.
     * Allow "LIKE"/"ILIKE" to be used as the operator in row and
       subselect comparisons (Fabien Coelho)
     * Avoid locale-specific case conversion of basic ASCII letters in
       identifiers and keywords (Tom)
       This solves the "Turkish problem" with mangling of words containing
       I and i. Folding of characters outside the 7-bit-ASCII set is still
       locale-aware.
     * Improve syntax error reporting (Fabien, Tom)
       Syntax error reports are more useful than before.
     * Change "EXECUTE" to return a completion tag matching the executed
       statement (Kris Jurka)
       Previous releases return an "EXECUTE" tag for any "EXECUTE" call.
       In this release, the tag returned will reflect the command
       executed.
     * Avoid emitting "NATURAL CROSS JOIN" in rule listings (Tom)
       Such a clause makes no logical sense, but in some cases the rule
       decompiler formerly produced this syntax.
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation Changes

     * Add "COMMENT ON" for casts, conversions, languages, operator
       classes, and large objects (Christopher)
     * Add new server configuration parameter default_with_oids to control
       whether tables are created with OIDs by default (Neil)
       This allows administrators to control whether "CREATE TABLE"
       commands create tables with or without OID columns by default.
       (Note: the current factory default setting for default_with_oids is
       TRUE, but the default will become FALSE in future releases.)
     * Add "WITH" / "WITHOUT OIDS" clause to "CREATE TABLE AS" (Neil)
     * Allow "ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN" to drop an OID column ("ALTER TABLE
       SET WITHOUT OIDS" still works) (Tom)
     * Allow composite types as table columns (Tom)
     * Allow "ALTER ... ADD COLUMN" with defaults and "NOT NULL"
       constraints; works per SQL spec (Rod)
       It is now possible for "ADD COLUMN" to create a column that is not
       initially filled with NULLs, but with a specified default value.
     * Add "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" to change column's type (Rod)
       It is now possible to alter a column's data type without dropping
       and re-adding the column.
     * Allow multiple "ALTER" actions in a single "ALTER TABLE" command
       (Rod)
       This is particularly useful for "ALTER" commands that rewrite the
       table (which include "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" and "ADD COLUMN" with a
       default). By grouping "ALTER" commands together, the table need be
       rewritten only once.
     * Allow "ALTER TABLE" to add SERIAL columns (Tom)
       This falls out from the new capability of specifying defaults for
       new columns.
     * Allow changing the owners of aggregates, conversions, databases,
       functions, operators, operator classes, schemas, types, and
       tablespaces (Christopher, Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
       Previously this required modifying the system tables directly.
     * Allow temporary object creation to be limited to "SECURITY DEFINER"
       functions (Sean Chittenden)
     * Add "ALTER TABLE ... SET WITHOUT CLUSTER" (Christopher)
       Prior to this release, there was no way to clear an auto-cluster
       specification except to modify the system tables.
     * Constraint/Index/SERIAL names are now "table_column_type" with
       numbers appended to guarantee uniqueness within the schema (Tom)
       The SQL specification states that such names should be unique
       within a schema.
     * Add pg_get_serial_sequence() to return a SERIAL column's sequence
       name (Christopher)
       This allows automated scripts to reliably find the SERIAL sequence
       name.
     * Warn when primary/foreign key data type mismatch requires costly
       lookup
     * New "ALTER INDEX" command to allow moving of indexes between
       tablespaces (Gavin)
     * Make "ALTER TABLE OWNER" change dependent sequence ownership too
       (Alvaro)
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Command Changes

     * Allow "CREATE SCHEMA" to create triggers, indexes, and sequences
       (Neil)
     * Add "ALSO" keyword to "CREATE RULE" (Fabien Coelho)
       This allows "ALSO" to be added to rule creation to contrast it with
       "INSTEAD" rules.
     * Add "NOWAIT" option to "LOCK" (Tatsuo)
       This allows the "LOCK" command to fail if it would have to wait for
       the requested lock.
     * Allow "COPY" to read and write comma-separated-value (CSV) files
       (Andrew, Bruce)
     * Generate error if the "COPY" delimiter and NULL string conflict
       (Bruce)
     * "GRANT"/"REVOKE" behavior follows the SQL spec more closely
     * Avoid locking conflict between "CREATE INDEX" and "CHECKPOINT"
       (Tom)
       In 7.3 and 7.4, a long-running B-tree index build could block
       concurrent "CHECKPOINT"s from completing, thereby causing WAL bloat
       because the WAL log could not be recycled.
     * Database-wide "ANALYZE" does not hold locks across tables (Tom)
       This reduces the potential for deadlocks against other backends
       that want exclusive locks on tables. To get the benefit of this
       change, do not execute database-wide "ANALYZE" inside a transaction
       block ("BEGIN" block); it must be able to commit and start a new
       transaction for each table.
     * "REINDEX" does not exclusively lock the index's parent table
       anymore
       The index itself is still exclusively locked, but readers of the
       table can continue if they are not using the particular index being
       rebuilt.
     * Erase MD5 user passwords when a user is renamed (Bruce)
       PostgreSQL uses the user name as salt when encrypting passwords via
       MD5. When a user's name is changed, the salt will no longer match
       the stored MD5 password, so the stored password becomes useless. In
       this release a notice is generated and the password is cleared. A
       new password must then be assigned if the user is to be able to log
       in with a password.
     * New pg_ctl "kill" option for Windows (Andrew)
       Windows does not have a kill command to send signals to backends so
       this capability was added to pg_ctl.
     * Information schema improvements
     * Add "--pwfile" option to initdb so the initial password can be set
       by GUI tools (Magnus)
     * Detect locale/encoding mismatch in initdb (Peter)
     * Add "register" command to pg_ctl to register Windows operating
       system service (Dave Page)
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Type and Function Changes

     * More complete support for composite types (row types) (Tom)
       Composite values can be used in many places where only scalar
       values worked before.
     * Reject nonrectangular array values as erroneous (Joe)
       Formerly, array_in would silently build a surprising result.
     * Overflow in integer arithmetic operations is now detected (Tom)
     * The arithmetic operators associated with the single-byte "char"
       data type have been removed.
       Formerly, the parser would select these operators in many
       situations where an "unable to select an operator" error would be
       more appropriate, such as null * null. If you actually want to do
       arithmetic on a "char" column, you can cast it to integer
       explicitly.
     * Syntax checking of array input values considerably tightened up
       (Joe)
       Junk that was previously allowed in odd places with odd results now
       causes an ERROR, for example, non-whitespace after the closing
       right brace.
     * Empty-string array element values must now be written as "", rather
       than writing nothing (Joe)
       Formerly, both ways of writing an empty-string element value were
       allowed, but now a quoted empty string is required. The case where
       nothing at all appears will probably be considered to be a NULL
       element value in some future release.
     * Array element trailing whitespace is now ignored (Joe)
       Formerly leading whitespace was ignored, but trailing whitespace
       between an element value and the delimiter or right brace was
       significant. Now trailing whitespace is also ignored.
     * Emit array values with explicit array bounds when lower bound is
       not one (Joe)
     * Accept YYYY-monthname-DD as a date string (Tom)
     * Make netmask and hostmask functions return maximum-length mask
       length (Tom)
     * Change factorial function to return numeric (Gavin)
       Returning numeric allows the factorial function to work for a wider
       range of input values.
     * to_char/to_date() date conversion improvements (Kurt Roeckx, Fabien
       Coelho)
     * Make length() disregard trailing spaces in CHAR(n) (Gavin)
       This change was made to improve consistency: trailing spaces are
       semantically insignificant in CHAR(n) data, so they should not be
       counted by length().
     * Warn about empty string being passed to OID/float4/float8 data
       types (Neil)
       8.1 will throw an error instead.
     * Allow leading or trailing whitespace in
       int2/int4/int8/float4/float8 input routines (Neil)
     * Better support for IEEE Infinity and NaN values in float4/float8
       (Neil)
       These should now work on all platforms that support IEEE-compliant
       floating point arithmetic.
     * Add "week" option to date_trunc() (Robert Creager)
     * Fix to_char for 1 BC (previously it returned 1 AD) (Bruce)
     * Fix date_part(year) for BC dates (previously it returned one less
       than the correct year) (Bruce)
     * Fix date_part() to return the proper millennium and century (Fabien
       Coelho)
       In previous versions, the century and millennium results had a
       wrong number and started in the wrong year, as compared to standard
       reckoning of such things.
     * Add ceiling() as an alias for ceil(), and power() as an alias for
       pow() for standards compliance (Neil)
     * Change ln(), log(), power(), and sqrt() to emit the correct
       SQLSTATE error codes for certain error conditions, as specified by
       SQL:2003 (Neil)
     * Add width_bucket() function as defined by SQL:2003 (Neil)
     * Add generate_series() functions to simplify working with numeric
       sets (Joe)
     * Fix upper/lower/initcap() functions to work with multibyte
       encodings (Tom)
     * Add boolean and bitwise integer "AND"/"OR" aggregates (Fabien
       Coelho)
     * New session information functions to return network addresses for
       client and server (Sean Chittenden)
     * Add function to determine the area of a closed path (Sean
       Chittenden)
     * Add function to send cancel request to other backends (Magnus)
     * Add interval plus datetime operators (Tom)
       The reverse ordering, datetime plus interval, was already
       supported, but both are required by the SQL standard.
     * Casting an integer to BIT(N) selects the rightmost N bits of the
       integer (Tom)
       In prior releases, the leftmost N bits were selected, but this was
       deemed unhelpful, not to mention inconsistent with casting from bit
       to int.
     * Require CIDR values to have all nonmasked bits be zero (Kevin
       Brintnall)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server-Side Language Changes

     * In READ COMMITTED serialization mode, volatile functions now see
       the results of concurrent transactions committed up to the
       beginning of each statement within the function, rather than up to
       the beginning of the interactive command that called the function.
     * Functions declared STABLE or IMMUTABLE always use the snapshot of
       the calling query, and therefore do not see the effects of actions
       taken after the calling query starts, whether in their own
       transaction or other transactions. Such a function must be
       read-only, too, meaning that it cannot use any SQL commands other
       than "SELECT". There is a considerable performance gain from
       declaring a function STABLE or IMMUTABLE rather than VOLATILE.
     * Nondeferred "AFTER" triggers are now fired immediately after
       completion of the triggering query, rather than upon finishing the
       current interactive command. This makes a difference when the
       triggering query occurred within a function: the trigger is invoked
       before the function proceeds to its next operation. For example, if
       a function inserts a new row into a table, any nondeferred foreign
       key checks occur before proceeding with the function.
     * Allow function parameters to be declared with names (Dennis
       Björklund)
       This allows better documentation of functions. Whether the names
       actually do anything depends on the specific function language
       being used.
     * Allow PL/pgSQL parameter names to be referenced in the function
       (Dennis Björklund)
       This basically creates an automatic alias for each named parameter.
     * Do minimal syntax checking of PL/pgSQL functions at creation time
       (Tom)
       This allows us to catch simple syntax errors sooner.
     * More support for composite types (row and record variables) in
       PL/pgSQL
       For example, it now works to pass a rowtype variable to another
       function as a single variable.
     * Default values for PL/pgSQL variables can now reference previously
       declared variables
     * Improve parsing of PL/pgSQL FOR loops (Tom)
       Parsing is now driven by presence of ".." rather than data type of
       "FOR" variable. This makes no difference for correct functions, but
       should result in more understandable error messages when a mistake
       is made.
     * Major overhaul of PL/Perl server-side language (Command Prompt,
       Andrew Dunstan)
     * In PL/Tcl, SPI commands are now run in subtransactions. If an error
       occurs, the subtransaction is cleaned up and the error is reported
       as an ordinary Tcl error, which can be trapped with catch.
       Formerly, it was not possible to catch such errors.
     * Accept "ELSEIF" in PL/pgSQL (Neil)
       Previously PL/pgSQL only allowed "ELSIF", but many people are
       accustomed to spelling this keyword "ELSEIF".
     __________________________________________________________________

psql Changes

     * Improve psql information display about database objects
       (Christopher)
     * Allow psql to display group membership in "\du" and "\dg" (Markus
       Bertheau)
     * Prevent psql "\dn" from showing temporary schemas (Bruce)
     * Allow psql to handle tilde user expansion for file names (Zach
       Irmen)
     * Allow psql to display fancy prompts, including color, via readline
       (Reece Hart, Chet Ramey)
     * Make psql "\copy" match "COPY" command syntax fully (Tom)
     * Show the location of syntax errors (Fabien Coelho, Tom)
     * Add "CLUSTER" information to psql "\d" display (Bruce)
     * Change psql "\copy stdin/stdout" to read from command input/output
       (Bruce)
     * Add "pstdin"/"pstdout" to read from psql's stdin/stdout (Mark Feit)
     * Add global psql configuration file, "psqlrc.sample" (Bruce)
       This allows a central file where global psql startup commands can
       be stored.
     * Have psql "\d+" indicate if the table has an OID column (Neil)
     * On Windows, use binary mode in psql when reading files so control-Z
       is not seen as end-of-file
     * Have "\dn+" show permissions and description for schemas (Dennis
       Björklund)
     * Improve tab completion support (Stefan Kaltenbrunn, Greg Sabino
       Mullane)
     * Allow boolean settings to be set using upper or lower case (Michael
       Paesold)
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump Changes

     * Use dependency information to improve the reliability of pg_dump
       (Tom)
       This should solve the longstanding problems with related objects
       sometimes being dumped in the wrong order.
     * Have pg_dump output objects in alphabetical order if possible (Tom)
       This should make it easier to identify changes between dump files.
     * Allow pg_restore to ignore some SQL errors (Fabien Coelho)
       This makes pg_restore's behavior similar to the results of feeding
       a pg_dump output script to psql. In most cases, ignoring errors and
       plowing ahead is the most useful thing to do. Also added was a
       pg_restore option to give the old behavior of exiting on an error.
     * pg_restore "-l" display now includes objects' schema names
     * New begin/end markers in pg_dump text output (Bruce)
     * Add start/stop times for pg_dump/pg_dumpall in verbose mode (Bruce)
     * Allow most pg_dump options in pg_dumpall (Christopher)
     * Have pg_dump use "ALTER OWNER" rather than "SET SESSION
       AUTHORIZATION" by default (Christopher)
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq Changes

     * Make libpq's "SIGPIPE" handling thread-safe (Bruce)
     * Add PQmbdsplen() which returns the display length of a character
       (Tatsuo)
     * Add thread locking to SSL and Kerberos connections (Manfred Spraul)
     * Allow PQoidValue(), PQcmdTuples(), and PQoidStatus() to work on
       "EXECUTE" commands (Neil)
     * Add PQserverVersion() to provide more convenient access to the
       server version number (Greg Sabino Mullane)
     * Add PQprepare/PQsendPrepared() functions to support preparing
       statements without necessarily specifying the data types of their
       parameters (Abhijit Menon-Sen)
     * Many ECPG improvements, including "SET DESCRIPTOR" (Michael)
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code Changes

     * Allow the database server to run natively on Windows (Claudio,
       Magnus, Andrew)
     * Shell script commands converted to C versions for Windows support
       (Andrew)
     * Create an extension makefile framework (Fabien Coelho, Peter)
       This simplifies the task of building extensions outside the
       original source tree.
     * Support relocatable installations (Bruce)
       Directory paths for installed files (such as the "/share"
       directory) are now computed relative to the actual location of the
       executables, so that an installation tree can be moved to another
       place without reconfiguring and rebuilding.
     * Use "--with-docdir" to choose installation location of
       documentation; also allow "--infodir" (Peter)
     * Add "--without-docdir" to prevent installation of documentation
       (Peter)
     * Upgrade to DocBook V4.2 SGML (Peter)
     * New PostgreSQL CVS tag (Marc)
       This was done to make it easier for organizations to manage their
       own copies of the PostgreSQL CVS repository. File version stamps
       from the master repository will not get munged by checking into or
       out of a copied repository.
     * Clarify locking code (Manfred Koizar)
     * Buffer manager cleanup (Neil)
     * Decouple platform tests from CPU spinlock code (Bruce, Tom)
     * Add inlined test-and-set code on PA-RISC for gcc (ViSolve, Tom)
     * Improve i386 spinlock code (Manfred Spraul)
     * Clean up spinlock assembly code to avoid warnings from newer gcc
       releases (Tom)
     * Remove JDBC from source tree; now a separate project
     * Remove the libpgtcl client interface; now a separate project
     * More accurately estimate memory and file descriptor usage (Tom)
     * Improvements to the Mac OS X startup scripts (Ray A.)
     * New fsync() test program (Bruce)
     * Major documentation improvements (Neil, Peter)
     * Remove pg_encoding; not needed anymore
     * Remove pg_id; not needed anymore
     * Remove initlocation; not needed anymore
     * Auto-detect thread flags (no more manual testing) (Bruce)
     * Use Olson's public domain timezone library (Magnus)
     * With threading enabled, use thread flags on Unixware for backend
       executables too (Bruce)
       Unixware cannot mix threaded and nonthreaded object files in the
       same executable, so everything must be compiled as threaded.
     * psql now uses a flex-generated lexical analyzer to process command
       strings
     * Reimplement the linked list data structure used throughout the
       backend (Neil)
       This improves performance by allowing list append and length
       operations to be more efficient.
     * Allow dynamically loaded modules to create their own server
       configuration parameters (Thomas Hallgren)
     * New Brazilian version of FAQ (Euler Taveira de Oliveira)
     * Add French FAQ (Guillaume Lelarge)
     * New pgevent for Windows logging
     * Make libpq and ECPG build as proper shared libraries on OS X (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib Changes

     * Overhaul of "contrib/dblink" (Joe)
     * "contrib/dbmirror" improvements (Steven Singer)
     * New "contrib/xml2" (John Gray, Torchbox)
     * Updated "contrib/mysql"
     * New version of "contrib/btree_gist" (Teodor)
     * New "contrib/trgm", trigram matching for PostgreSQL (Teodor)
     * Many "contrib/tsearch2" improvements (Teodor)
     * Add double metaphone to "contrib/fuzzystrmatch" (Andrew)
     * Allow "contrib/pg_autovacuum" to run as a Windows service (Dave

                               Release 7.4.13

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.12, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.13

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 may require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       may require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote is
       in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations and standard_conforming_strings
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also
       future-proofs them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard
       string literal syntax. Applications that use multiple PostgreSQL
       connections concurrently should migrate to PQescapeStringConn() and
       PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that escaping is done correctly for
       the settings in use in each database connection. Applications that
       do string escaping "by hand" should be modified to rely on library
       routines instead.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, alt_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Fix bug that sometimes caused OR'd index scans to miss rows they
       should have returned
     * Fix WAL replay for case where a btree index has been truncated
     * Fix SIMILAR TO for patterns involving | (Tom)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Fix for Bonjour on Intel Macs (Ashley Clark)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks

     Release date: 2006-02-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.12

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.11, see the release notes
   for 7.4.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix potential crash in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" (CVE-2006-0553)
       An unprivileged user could crash the server process, resulting in
       momentary denial of service to other users, if the server has been
       compiled with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to
       Akio Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 7.4.9 and 7.3.11 releases.
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog file creation (Tom)
     * Properly check DOMAIN constraints for UNKNOWN parameters in
       prepared statements (Neil)
     * Fix to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators (Tom)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.4.11

     Release date: 2006-01-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.10.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.11

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.8, see the release notes
   for 7.4.8. Also, you might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual columns
   after updating, if you are affected by the locale or plperl issues
   described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix for protocol-level Describe messages issued outside a
       transaction or in a failed transaction (Tom)
     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You may need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)
     __________________________________________________________________

     Release date: 2005-12-12

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.9.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.10

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.8, see the release notes
   for 7.4.8.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix race condition in transaction log management
       There was a narrow window in which an I/O operation could be
       initiated for the wrong page, leading to an Assert failure or data
       corruption.
     * Prevent failure if client sends Bind protocol message when current
       transaction is already aborted
     * "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * AIX and HPUX compile fixes (Tom)
     * Fix longstanding planning error for outer joins
       This bug sometimes caused a bogus error "RIGHT JOIN is only
       supported with merge-joinable join conditions".
     * Prevent core dump in pg_autovacuum when a table has been dropped

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.9

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.4.8, see the release notes
   for 7.4.8.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix error that allowed "VACUUM" to remove ctid chains too soon, and
       add more checking in code that follows ctid links
       This fixes a long-standing problem that could cause crashes in very
       rare circumstances.
     * Fix CHAR() to properly pad spaces to the specified length when
       using a multiple-byte character set (Yoshiyuki Asaba)
       In prior releases, the padding of CHAR() was incorrect because it
       only padded to the specified number of bytes without considering
       how many characters were stored.
     * Fix the sense of the test for read-only transaction in "COPY"
       The code formerly prohibited "COPY TO", where it should prohibit
       "COPY FROM".
     * Fix planning problem with outer-join ON clauses that reference only
       the inner-side relation
     * Further fixes for x FULL JOIN y ON true corner cases
     * Make array_in and array_recv more paranoid about validating their
       OID parameter
     * Fix missing rows in queries like UPDATE a=... WHERE a... with GiST
       index on column a
     * Improve robustness of datetime parsing
     * Improve checking for partially-written WAL pages
     * Improve robustness of signal handling when SSL is enabled
     * Don't try to open more than max_files_per_process files during
       postmaster startup
     * Various memory leakage fixes
     * Various portability improvements
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to handle var := var correctly when the variable is of
       pass-by-reference type
     * Update "contrib/tsearch2" to use current Snowball code
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.4.8

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.7, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, it is
   one possible way of handling two significant security problems that
   have been found in the initial contents of 7.4.X system catalogs. A
   dump/initdb/reload sequence using 7.4.8's initdb will automatically
   correct these problems.

   The larger security problem is that the built-in character set encoding
   conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged
   users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not
   secure against malicious choices of arguments. The fix involves
   changing the declared parameter list of these functions so that they
   can no longer be invoked from SQL commands. (This does not affect their
   normal use by the encoding conversion machinery.)

   The lesser problem is that the "contrib/tsearch2" module creates
   several functions that are misdeclared to return internal when they do
   not accept internal arguments. This breaks type safety for all
   functions using internal arguments.

   It is strongly recommended that all installations repair these errors,
   either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedures given
   below. The errors at least allow unprivileged database users to crash
   their server process, and may allow unprivileged users to gain the
   privileges of a database superuser.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the following procedures
   instead. As the database superuser, do:
BEGIN;
UPDATE pg_proc SET proargtypes[3] = 'internal'::regtype
WHERE pronamespace = 11 AND pronargs = 5
      AND proargtypes[2] = 'cstring'::regtype;
-- The command should report having updated 90 rows;
-- if not, rollback and investigate instead of committing!
COMMIT;

   Next, if you have installed "contrib/tsearch2", do
BEGIN;
UPDATE pg_proc SET proargtypes[0] = 'internal'::regtype
WHERE oid IN (
    'dex_init(text)'::regprocedure,
    'snb_en_init(text)'::regprocedure,
    'snb_ru_init(text)'::regprocedure,
    'spell_init(text)'::regprocedure,
    'syn_init(text)'::regprocedure
);
-- The command should report having updated 5 rows;
-- if not, rollback and investigate instead of committing!
COMMIT;

   If this command fails with a message like "function "dex_init(text)"
   does not exist", then either "tsearch2" is not installed in this
   database, or you already did the update.

   The above procedures must be carried out in *each* database of an
   installation, including template1, and ideally including template0 as
   well. If you do not fix the template databases then any subsequently
   created databases will contain the same errors. template1 can be fixed
   in the same way as any other database, but fixing template0 requires
   additional steps. First, from any database issue
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';

   Next connect to template0 and perform the above repair procedures.
   Finally, do
-- re-freeze template0:
VACUUM FREEZE;
-- and protect it against future alterations:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change encoding function signature to prevent misuse
     * Change "contrib/tsearch2" to avoid unsafe use of INTERNAL function
       results
     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix comparisons of TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
       The comparison code was wrong in the case where the
       --enable-integer-datetimes configuration switch had been used.
       NOTE: if you have an index on a TIME WITH TIME ZONE column, it will
       need to be "REINDEX"ed after installing this update, because the
       fix corrects the sort order of column values.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Fix mis-display of negative fractional seconds in INTERVAL values
       This error only occurred when the --enable-integer-datetimes
       configuration switch had been used.
     * Ensure operations done during backend shutdown are counted by
       statistics collector
       This is expected to resolve reports of pg_autovacuum not vacuuming
       the system catalogs often enough -- it was not being told about
       catalog deletions caused by temporary table removal during backend
       exit.
     * Additional buffer overrun checks in plpgsql (Neil)
     * Fix pg_dump to dump trigger names containing % correctly (Neil)
     * Fix "contrib/pgcrypto" for newer OpenSSL builds (Marko Kreen)
     * Still more 64-bit fixes for "contrib/intagg"
     * Prevent incorrect optimization of functions returning RECORD
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from dumping core for month-related
       formats
     * Prevent crash on COALESCE(NULL,NULL)
     * Fix array_map to call PL functions correctly
     * Fix permission checking in "ALTER DATABASE RENAME"
     * Fix "ALTER LANGUAGE RENAME"
     * Make RemoveFromWaitQueue clean up after itself
       This fixes a lock management error that would only be visible if a
       transaction was kicked out of a wait for a lock (typically by query
       cancel) and then the holder of the lock released it within a very
       narrow window.
     * Fix problem with untyped parameter appearing in "INSERT ... SELECT"
     * Fix "CLUSTER" failure after "ALTER TABLE SET WITHOUT OIDS"

                                Release 7.4.7

     Release date: 2005-01-31

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.6, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Check that creator of an aggregate function has the right to
       execute the specified transition functions
       This oversight made it possible to bypass denial of EXECUTE
       permission on a function.
     * Fix security and 64-bit issues in contrib/intagg
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Fix plperl for quote marks in tuple fields
     * Fix display of negative intervals in SQL and GERMAN datestyles
     * Make age(timestamptz) do calculation in local timezone not GMT

                                Release 7.4.6

     Release date: 2004-10-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair possible failure to update hint bits on disk
       Under rare circumstances this oversight could lead to "could not
       access transaction status" failures, which qualifies it as a
       potential-data-loss bug.
     * Ensure that hashed outer join does not miss tuples
       Very large left joins using a hash join plan could fail to output
       unmatched left-side rows given just the right data distribution.
     * Disallow running pg_ctl as root
       This is to guard against any possible security issues.
     * Avoid using temp files in "/tmp" in "make_oidjoins_check"
       This has been reported as a security issue, though it's hardly
       worthy of concern since there is no reason for non-developers to
       use this script anyway.
     * Prevent forced backend shutdown from re-emitting prior command
       result
       In rare cases, a client might think that its last command had
       succeeded when it really had been aborted by forced database
       shutdown.
     * Repair bug in pg_stat_get_backend_idset
       This could lead to misbehavior in some of the system-statistics
       views.
     * Fix small memory leak in postmaster
     * Fix "expected both swapped tables to have TOAST tables" bug
       This could arise in cases such as CLUSTER after ALTER TABLE DROP
       COLUMN.
     * Prevent pg_ctl restart from adding -D multiple times
     * Fix problem with NULL values in GiST indexes
     * :: is no longer interpreted as a variable in an ECPG prepare
       statement

   This release contains one serious bug fix over 7.4.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair possible crash during concurrent B-tree index insertions
       This patch fixes a rare case in which concurrent insertions into a
       B-tree index could result in a server panic. No permanent damage
       would result, but it's still worth a re-release. The bug does not
       exist in pre-7.4 releases.

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.4

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent possible loss of committed transactions during crash
       Due to insufficient interlocking between transaction commit and
       checkpointing, it was possible for transactions committed just
       before the most recent checkpoint to be lost, in whole or in part,
       following a database crash and restart. This is a serious bug that
       has existed since PostgreSQL 7.1.
     * Check HAVING restriction before evaluating result list of an
       aggregate plan
     * Avoid crash when session's current user ID is deleted
     * Fix hashed crosstab for zero-rows case (Joe)
     * Force cache update after renaming a column in a foreign key
     * Pretty-print UNION queries correctly
     * Make psql handle \r\n newlines properly in COPY IN
     * pg_dump handled ACLs with grant options incorrectly
     * Fix thread support for OS X and Solaris
     * Updated JDBC driver (build 215) with various fixes
     * ECPG fixes
     * Translation updates (various contributors)

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.3

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix temporary memory leak when using non-hashed aggregates (Tom)
     * ECPG fixes, including some for Informix compatibility (Michael)
     * Fixes for compiling with thread-safety, particularly Solaris
       (Bruce)
     * Fix error in COPY IN termination when using the old network
       protocol (ljb)
     * Several important fixes in pg_autovacuum, including fixes for large
       tables, unsigned oids, stability, temp tables, and debug mode
       (Matthew T. O'Connor)
     * Fix problem with reading tar-format dumps on NetBSD and BSD/OS
       (Bruce)
     * Several JDBC fixes
     * Fix ALTER SEQUENCE RESTART where last_value equals the restart
       value (Tom)
     * Repair failure to recalculate nested sub-selects (Tom)
     * Fix problems with non-constant expressions in LIMIT/OFFSET
     * Support FULL JOIN with no join clause, such as X FULL JOIN Y ON
       TRUE (Tom)
     * Fix another zero-column table bug (Tom)
     * Improve handling of non-qualified identifiers in GROUP BY clauses
       in sub-selects (Tom)
       Select-list aliases within the sub-select will now take precedence
       over names from outer query levels.
     * Do not generate "NATURAL CROSS JOIN" when decompiling rules (Tom)
     * Add checks for invalid field length in binary COPY (Tom)
       This fixes a difficult-to-exploit security hole.
     * Avoid locking conflict between "ANALYZE" and "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY"
     * Numerous translation updates (various contributors)

                                Release 7.4.2

     Release date: 2004-03-08

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.2

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X. However, it may
   be advisable as the easiest method of incorporating fixes for two
   errors that have been found in the initial contents of 7.4.X system
   catalogs. A dump/initdb/reload sequence using 7.4.2's initdb will
   automatically correct these problems.

   The more severe of the two errors is that data type anyarray has the
   wrong alignment label; this is a problem because the pg_statistic
   system catalog uses anyarray columns. The mislabeling can cause planner
   misestimations and even crashes when planning queries that involve
   WHERE clauses on double-aligned columns (such as float8 and timestamp).
   It is strongly recommended that all installations repair this error,
   either by initdb or by following the manual repair procedure given
   below.

   The lesser error is that the system view pg_settings ought to be marked
   as having public update access, to allow UPDATE pg_settings to be used
   as a substitute for "SET". This can also be fixed either by initdb or
   manually, but it is not necessary to fix unless you want to use UPDATE
   pg_settings.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, the following procedure will work for
   fixing pg_statistic. As the database superuser, do:
-- clear out old data in pg_statistic:
DELETE FROM pg_statistic;
VACUUM pg_statistic;
-- this should update 1 row:
UPDATE pg_type SET typalign = 'd' WHERE oid = 2277;
-- this should update 6 rows:
UPDATE pg_attribute SET attalign = 'd' WHERE atttypid = 2277;
--
-- At this point you MUST start a fresh backend to avoid a crash!
--
-- repopulate pg_statistic:
ANALYZE;

   This can be done in a live database, but beware that all backends
   running in the altered database must be restarted before it is safe to
   repopulate pg_statistic.

   To repair the pg_settings error, simply do:
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON pg_settings TO PUBLIC;

   The above procedures must be carried out in *each* database of an
   installation, including template1, and ideally including template0 as
   well. If you do not fix the template databases then any subsequently
   created databases will contain the same errors. template1 can be fixed
   in the same way as any other database, but fixing template0 requires
   additional steps. First, from any database issue
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';

   Next connect to template0 and perform the above repair procedures.
   Finally, do
-- re-freeze template0:
VACUUM FREEZE;
-- and protect it against future alterations:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';

                                Release 7.4.1

     Release date: 2003-12-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4.1

   A dump/restore is *not* required for those running 7.4.

   If you want to install the fixes in the information schema you need to
   reload it into the database. This is either accomplished by
   initializing a new cluster by running "initdb", or by running the
   following sequence of SQL commands in each database (ideally including
   template1) as a superuser in psql, after installing the new release:
DROP SCHEMA information_schema CASCADE;
\i /usr/local/pgsql/share/information_schema.sql

   Substitute your installation path in the second command.

                                 Release 7.4

     Release date: 2003-11-17
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   IN / NOT IN subqueries are now much more efficient
          In previous releases, IN/NOT IN subqueries were joined to the
          upper query by sequentially scanning the subquery looking for a
          match. The 7.4 code uses the same sophisticated techniques used
          by ordinary joins and so is much faster. An IN will now usually
          be as fast as or faster than an equivalent EXISTS subquery; this
          reverses the conventional wisdom that applied to previous
          releases.

   Improved GROUP BY processing by using hash buckets
          In previous releases, rows to be grouped had to be sorted first.
          The 7.4 code can do GROUP BY without sorting, by accumulating
          results into a hash table with one entry per group. It will
          still use the sort technique, however, if the hash table is
          estimated to be too large to fit in sort_mem.

   New multikey hash join capability
          In previous releases, hash joins could only occur on single
          keys. This release allows multicolumn hash joins.

   Queries using the explicit JOIN syntax are now better optimized
          Prior releases evaluated queries using the explicit JOIN syntax
          only in the order implied by the syntax. 7.4 allows full
          optimization of these queries, meaning the optimizer considers
          all possible join orderings and chooses the most efficient.
          Outer joins, however, must still follow the declared ordering.

   Faster and more powerful regular expression code
          The entire regular expression module has been replaced with a
          new version by Henry Spencer, originally written for Tcl. The
          code greatly improves performance and supports several flavors
          of regular expressions.

   Function-inlining for simple SQL functions
          Simple SQL functions can now be inlined by including their SQL
          in the main query. This improves performance by eliminating
          per-call overhead. That means simple SQL functions now behave
          like macros.

   Full support for IPv6 connections and IPv6 address data types
          Previous releases allowed only IPv4 connections, and the IP data
          types only supported IPv4 addresses. This release adds full IPv6
          support in both of these areas.

   Major improvements in SSL performance and reliability
          Several people very familiar with the SSL API have overhauled
          our SSL code to improve SSL key negotiation and error recovery.

   Make free space map efficiently reuse empty index pages, and other free
          space management improvements
          In previous releases, B-tree index pages that were left empty
          because of deleted rows could only be reused by rows with index
          values similar to the rows originally indexed on that page. In
          7.4, "VACUUM" records empty index pages and allows them to be
          reused for any future index rows.

   SQL-standard information schema
          The information schema provides a standardized and stable way to
          access information about the schema objects defined in a
          database.

   Cursors conform more closely to the SQL standard
          The commands "FETCH" and "MOVE" have been overhauled to conform
          more closely to the SQL standard.

   Cursors can exist outside transactions
          These cursors are also called holdable cursors.

   New client-to-server protocol
          The new protocol adds error codes, more status information,
          faster startup, better support for binary data transmission,
          parameter values separated from SQL commands, prepared
          statements available at the protocol level, and cleaner recovery
          from "COPY" failures. The older protocol is still supported by
          both server and clients.

   libpq and ECPG applications are now fully thread-safe
          While previous libpq releases already supported threads, this
          release improves thread safety by fixing some non-thread-safe
          code that was used during database connection startup. The
          "configure" option "--enable-thread-safety" must be used to
          enable this feature.

   New version of full-text indexing
          A new full-text indexing suite is available in
          "contrib/tsearch2".

   New autovacuum tool
          The new autovacuum tool in "contrib/autovacuum" monitors the
          database statistics tables for "INSERT"/"UPDATE"/"DELETE"
          activity and automatically vacuums tables when needed.

   Array handling has been improved and moved into the server core
          Many array limitations have been removed, and arrays behave more
          like fully-supported data types.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.4

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * The server-side autocommit setting was removed and reimplemented in
       client applications and languages. Server-side autocommit was
       causing too many problems with languages and applications that
       wanted to control their own autocommit behavior, so autocommit was
       removed from the server and added to individual client APIs as
       appropriate.
     * Error message wording has changed substantially in this release.
       Significant effort was invested to make the messages more
       consistent and user-oriented. If your applications try to detect
       different error conditions by parsing the error message, you are
       strongly encouraged to use the new error code facility instead.
     * Inner joins using the explicit JOIN syntax may behave differently
       because they are now better optimized.
     * A number of server configuration parameters have been renamed for
       clarity, primarily those related to logging.
     * FETCH 0 or MOVE 0 now does nothing. In prior releases, FETCH 0
       would fetch all remaining rows, and MOVE 0 would move to the end of
       the cursor.
     * "FETCH" and "MOVE" now return the actual number of rows
       fetched/moved, or zero if at the beginning/end of the cursor. Prior
       releases would return the row count passed to the command, not the
       number of rows actually fetched or moved.
     * "COPY" now can process files that use carriage-return or
       carriage-return/line-feed end-of-line sequences. Literal
       carriage-returns and line-feeds are no longer accepted in data
       values; use \r and \n instead.
     * Trailing spaces are now trimmed when converting from type char(n)
       to varchar(n) or text. This is what most people always expected to
       happen anyway.
     * The data type float(p) now measures "p" in binary digits, not
       decimal digits. The new behavior follows the SQL standard.
     * Ambiguous date values now must match the ordering specified by the
       datestyle setting. In prior releases, a date specification of
       10/20/03 was interpreted as a date in October even if datestyle
       specified that the day should be first. 7.4 will throw an error if
       a date specification is invalid for the current setting of
       datestyle.
     * The functions oidrand, oidsrand, and userfntest have been removed.
       These functions were determined to be no longer useful.
     * String literals specifying time-varying date/time values, such as
       'now' or 'today' will no longer work as expected in column default
       expressions; they now cause the time of the table creation to be
       the default, not the time of the insertion. Functions such as
       now(), current_timestamp, or current_date should be used instead.
       In previous releases, there was special code so that strings such
       as 'now' were interpreted at "INSERT" time and not at table
       creation time, but this work around didn't cover all cases. Release
       7.4 now requires that defaults be defined properly using functions
       such as now() or current_timestamp. These will work in all
       situations.
     * The dollar sign ($) is no longer allowed in operator names. It can
       instead be a non-first character in identifiers. This was done to
       improve compatibility with other database systems, and to avoid
       syntax problems when parameter placeholders ($n) are written
       adjacent to operators.

Changes

   Below you will find a detailed account of the changes between release
   7.4 and the previous major release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Operation Changes

     * Allow IPv6 server connections (Nigel Kukard, Johan Jordaan, Bruce,
       Tom, Kurt Roeckx, Andrew Dunstan)
     * Fix SSL to handle errors cleanly (Nathan Mueller)
       In prior releases, certain SSL API error reports were not handled
       correctly. This release fixes those problems.
     * SSL protocol security and performance improvements (Sean
       Chittenden)
       SSL key renegotiation was happening too frequently, causing poor
       SSL performance. Also, initial key handling was improved.
     * Print lock information when a deadlock is detected (Tom)
       This allows easier debugging of deadlock situations.
     * Update "/tmp" socket modification times regularly to avoid their
       removal (Tom)
       This should help prevent "/tmp" directory cleaner administration
       scripts from removing server socket files.
     * Enable PAM for Mac OS X (Aaron Hillegass)
     * Make B-tree indexes fully WAL-safe (Tom)
       In prior releases, under certain rare cases, a server crash could
       cause B-tree indexes to become corrupt. This release removes those
       last few rare cases.
     * Allow B-tree index compaction and empty page reuse (Tom)
     * Fix inconsistent index lookups during split of first root page
       (Tom)
       In prior releases, when a single-page index split into two pages,
       there was a brief period when another database session could miss
       seeing an index entry. This release fixes that rare failure case.
     * Improve free space map allocation logic (Tom)
     * Preserve free space information between server restarts (Tom)
       In prior releases, the free space map was not saved when the
       postmaster was stopped, so newly started servers had no free space
       information. This release saves the free space map, and reloads it
       when the server is restarted.
     * Add start time to pg_stat_activity (Neil)
     * New code to detect corrupt disk pages; erase with
       zero_damaged_pages (Tom)
     * New client/server protocol: faster, no username length limit, allow
       clean exit from "COPY" (Tom)
     * Add transaction status, table ID, column ID to client/server
       protocol (Tom)
     * Add binary I/O to client/server protocol (Tom)
     * Remove autocommit server setting; move to client applications (Tom)
     * New error message wording, error codes, and three levels of error
       detail (Tom, Joe, Peter)
     __________________________________________________________________

Performance Improvements

     * Add hashing for GROUP BY aggregates (Tom)
     * Make nested-loop joins be smarter about multicolumn indexes (Tom)
     * Allow multikey hash joins (Tom)
     * Improve constant folding (Tom)
     * Add ability to inline simple SQL functions (Tom)
     * Reduce memory usage for queries using complex functions (Tom)
       In prior releases, functions returning allocated memory would not
       free it until the query completed. This release allows the freeing
       of function-allocated memory when the function call completes,
       reducing the total memory used by functions.
     * Improve GEQO optimizer performance (Tom)
       This release fixes several inefficiencies in the way the GEQO
       optimizer manages potential query paths.
     * Allow IN/NOT IN to be handled via hash tables (Tom)
     * Improve NOT IN (subquery) performance (Tom)
     * Allow most IN subqueries to be processed as joins (Tom)
     * Pattern matching operations can use indexes regardless of locale
       (Peter)
       There is no way for non-ASCII locales to use the standard indexes
       for LIKE comparisons. This release adds a way to create a special
       index for LIKE.
     * Allow the postmaster to preload libraries using preload_libraries
       (Joe)
       For shared libraries that require a long time to load, this option
       is available so the library can be preloaded in the postmaster and
       inherited by all database sessions.
     * Improve optimizer cost computations, particularly for subqueries
       (Tom)
     * Avoid sort when subquery ORDER BY matches upper query (Tom)
     * Deduce that WHERE a.x = b.y AND b.y = 42 also means a.x = 42 (Tom)
     * Allow hash/merge joins on complex joins (Tom)
     * Allow hash joins for more data types (Tom)
     * Allow join optimization of explicit inner joins, disable with
       join_collapse_limit (Tom)
     * Add parameter from_collapse_limit to control conversion of
       subqueries to joins (Tom)
     * Use faster and more powerful regular expression code from Tcl
       (Henry Spencer, Tom)
     * Use bit-mapped relation sets in the optimizer (Tom)
     * Improve connection startup time (Tom)
       The new client/server protocol requires fewer network packets to
       start a database session.
     * Improve trigger/constraint performance (Stephan)
     * Improve speed of col IN (const, const, const, ...) (Tom)
     * Fix hash indexes which were broken in rare cases (Tom)
     * Improve hash index concurrency and speed (Tom)
       Prior releases suffered from poor hash index performance,
       particularly for high concurrency situations. This release fixes
       that, and the development group is interested in reports comparing
       B-tree and hash index performance.
     * Align shared buffers on 32-byte boundary for copy speed improvement
       (Manfred Spraul)
       Certain CPU's perform faster data copies when addresses are 32-byte
       aligned.
     * Data type numeric reimplemented for better performance (Tom)
       numeric used to be stored in base 100. The new code uses base
       10000, for significantly better performance.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Configuration Changes

     * Rename server parameter server_min_messages to log_min_messages
       (Bruce)
       This was done so most parameters that control the server logs begin
       with log_.
     * Rename show_*_stats to log_*_stats (Bruce)
     * Rename show_source_port to log_source_port (Bruce)
     * Rename hostname_lookup to log_hostname (Bruce)
     * Add checkpoint_warning to warn of excessive checkpointing (Bruce)
       In prior releases, it was difficult to determine if checkpoint was
       happening too frequently. This feature adds a warning to the server
       logs when excessive checkpointing happens.
     * New read-only server parameters for localization (Tom)
     * Change debug server log messages to output as DEBUG rather than LOG
       (Bruce)
     * Prevent server log variables from being turned off by
       non-superusers (Bruce)
       This is a security feature so non-superusers cannot disable logging
       that was enabled by the administrator.
     * log_min_messages/client_min_messages now controls debug_* output
       (Bruce)
       This centralizes client debug information so all debug output can
       be sent to either the client or server logs.
     * Add Mac OS X Rendezvous server support (Chris Campbell)
       This allows Mac OS X hosts to query the network for available
       PostgreSQL servers.
     * Add ability to print only slow statements using
       log_min_duration_statement (Christopher)
       This is an often requested debugging feature that allows
       administrators to see only slow queries in their server logs.
     * Allow "pg_hba.conf" to accept netmasks in CIDR format (Andrew
       Dunstan)
       This allows administrators to merge the host IP address and netmask
       fields into a single CIDR field in "pg_hba.conf".
     * New read-only parameter is_superuser (Tom)
     * New parameter log_error_verbosity to control error detail (Tom)
       This works with the new error reporting feature to supply
       additional error information like hints, file names and line
       numbers.
     * postgres --describe-config now dumps server config variables (Aizaz
       Ahmed, Peter)
       This option is useful for administration tools that need to know
       the configuration variable names and their minimums, maximums,
       defaults, and descriptions.
     * Add new columns in pg_settings: context, type, source, min_val,
       max_val (Joe)
     * Make default shared_buffers 1000 and max_connections 100, if
       possible (Tom)
       Prior versions defaulted to 64 shared buffers so PostgreSQL would
       start on even very old systems. This release tests the amount of
       shared memory allowed by the platform and selects more reasonable
       default values if possible. Of course, users are still encouraged
       to evaluate their resource load and size shared_buffers
       accordingly.
     * New "pg_hba.conf" record type hostnossl to prevent SSL connections
       (Jon Jensen)
       In prior releases, there was no way to prevent SSL connections if
       both the client and server supported SSL. This option allows that
       capability.
     * Remove parameter geqo_random_seed (Tom)
     * Add server parameter regex_flavor to control regular expression
       processing (Tom)
     * Make "pg_ctl" better handle nonstandard ports (Greg)
     __________________________________________________________________

Query Changes

     * New SQL-standard information schema (Peter)
     * Add read-only transactions (Peter)
     * Print key name and value in foreign-key violation messages (Dmitry
       Tkach)
     * Allow users to see their own queries in pg_stat_activity (Kevin
       Brown)
       In prior releases, only the superuser could see query strings using
       pg_stat_activity. Now ordinary users can see their own query
       strings.
     * Fix aggregates in subqueries to match SQL standard (Tom)
       The SQL standard says that an aggregate function appearing within a
       nested subquery belongs to the outer query if its argument contains
       only outer-query variables. Prior PostgreSQL releases did not
       handle this fine point correctly.
     * Add option to prevent auto-addition of tables referenced in query
       (Nigel J. Andrews)
       By default, tables mentioned in the query are automatically added
       to the FROM clause if they are not already there. This is
       compatible with historic POSTGRES behavior but is contrary to the
       SQL standard. This option allows selecting standard-compatible
       behavior.
     * Allow UPDATE ... SET col = DEFAULT (Rod)
       This allows "UPDATE" to set a column to its declared default value.
     * Allow expressions to be used in LIMIT/OFFSET (Tom)
       In prior releases, LIMIT/OFFSET could only use constants, not
       expressions.
     * Implement CREATE TABLE AS EXECUTE (Neil, Peter)
     __________________________________________________________________

Object Manipulation Changes

     * Make "CREATE SEQUENCE" grammar more conforming to SQL:2003 (Neil)
     * Add statement-level triggers (Neil)
       While this allows a trigger to fire at the end of a statement, it
       does not allow the trigger to access all rows modified by the
       statement. This capability is planned for a future release.
     * Add check constraints for domains (Rod)
       This greatly increases the usefulness of domains by allowing them
       to use check constraints.
     * Add "ALTER DOMAIN" (Rod)
       This allows manipulation of existing domains.
     * Fix several zero-column table bugs (Tom)
       PostgreSQL supports zero-column tables. This fixes various bugs
       that occur when using such tables.
     * Have ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY add not-null constraint (Rod)
       In prior releases, ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY would add a unique
       index, but not a not-null constraint. That is fixed in this
       release.
     * Add ALTER TABLE ... WITHOUT OIDS (Rod)
       This allows control over whether new and updated rows will have an
       OID column. This is most useful for saving storage space.
     * Add ALTER SEQUENCE to modify minimum, maximum, increment, cache,
       cycle values (Rod)
     * Add ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER ON (Alvaro Herrera)
       This command is used by "pg_dump" to record the cluster column for
       each table previously clustered. This information is used by
       database-wide cluster to cluster all previously clustered tables.
     * Improve automatic type casting for domains (Rod, Tom)
     * Allow dollar signs in identifiers, except as first character (Tom)
     * Disallow dollar signs in operator names, so x=$1 works (Tom)
     * Allow copying table schema using LIKE subtable, also SQL:2003
       feature INCLUDING DEFAULTS (Rod)
     * Add WITH GRANT OPTION clause to "GRANT" (Peter)
       This enabled "GRANT" to give other users the ability to grant
       privileges on a object.
     __________________________________________________________________

Utility Command Changes

     * Add ON COMMIT clause to "CREATE TABLE" for temporary tables (Gavin)
       This adds the ability for a table to be dropped or all rows deleted
       on transaction commit.
     * Allow cursors outside transactions using WITH HOLD (Neil)
       In previous releases, cursors were removed at the end of the
       transaction that created them. Cursors can now be created with the
       WITH HOLD option, which allows them to continue to be accessed
       after the creating transaction has committed.
     * FETCH 0 and MOVE 0 now do nothing (Bruce)
       In previous releases, FETCH 0 fetched all remaining rows, and MOVE
       0 moved to the end of the cursor.
     * Cause "FETCH" and "MOVE" to return the number of rows
       fetched/moved, or zero if at the beginning/end of cursor, per SQL
       standard (Bruce)
       In prior releases, the row count returned by "FETCH" and "MOVE" did
       not accurately reflect the number of rows processed.
     * Properly handle SCROLL with cursors, or report an error (Neil)
       Allowing random access (both forward and backward scrolling) to
       some kinds of queries cannot be done without some additional work.
       If SCROLL is specified when the cursor is created, this additional
       work will be performed. Furthermore, if the cursor has been created
       with NO SCROLL, no random access is allowed.
     * Implement SQL-compatible options FIRST, LAST, ABSOLUTE n, RELATIVE
       n for "FETCH" and "MOVE" (Tom)
     * Allow "EXPLAIN" on "DECLARE CURSOR" (Tom)
     * Allow "CLUSTER" to use index marked as pre-clustered by default
       (Alvaro Herrera)
     * Allow "CLUSTER" to cluster all tables (Alvaro Herrera)
       This allows all previously clustered tables in a database to be
       reclustered with a single command.
     * Prevent "CLUSTER" on partial indexes (Tom)
     * Allow DOS and Mac line-endings in "COPY" files (Bruce)
     * Disallow literal carriage return as a data value,
       backslash-carriage-return and \r are still allowed (Bruce)
     * "COPY" changes (binary, \.) (Tom)
     * Recover from "COPY" failure cleanly (Tom)
     * Prevent possible memory leaks in "COPY" (Tom)
     * Make "TRUNCATE" transaction-safe (Rod)
       "TRUNCATE" can now be used inside a transaction. If the transaction
       aborts, the changes made by the "TRUNCATE" are automatically rolled
       back.
     * Allow prepare/bind of utility commands like "FETCH" and "EXPLAIN"
       (Tom)
     * Add "EXPLAIN EXECUTE" (Neil)
     * Improve "VACUUM" performance on indexes by reducing WAL traffic
       (Tom)
     * Functional indexes have been generalized into indexes on
       expressions (Tom)
       In prior releases, functional indexes only supported a simple
       function applied to one or more column names. This release allows
       any type of scalar expression.
     * Have "SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION" match input to "SET TRANSACTION
       ISOLATION" (Tom)
     * Have "COMMENT ON DATABASE" on nonlocal database generate a warning,
       rather than an error (Rod)
       Database comments are stored in database-local tables so comments
       on a database have to be stored in each database.
     * Improve reliability of "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" (Tom)
     * Allow "REINDEX" to reliably reindex nonshared system catalog
       indexes (Tom)
       This allows system tables to be reindexed without the requirement
       of a standalone session, which was necessary in previous releases.
       The only tables that now require a standalone session for
       reindexing are the global system tables pg_database, pg_shadow, and
       pg_group.
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Type and Function Changes

     * New server parameter extra_float_digits to control precision
       display of floating-point numbers (Pedro Ferreira, Tom)
       This controls output precision which was causing regression testing
       problems.
     * Allow +1300 as a numeric time-zone specifier, for FJST (Tom)
     * Remove rarely used functions oidrand, oidsrand, and userfntest
       functions (Neil)
     * Add md5() function to main server, already in "contrib/pgcrypto"
       (Joe)
       An MD5 function was frequently requested. For more complex
       encryption capabilities, use "contrib/pgcrypto".
     * Increase date range of timestamp (John Cochran)
     * Change EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp) so timestamp without time zone
       is assumed to be in local time, not GMT (Tom)
     * Trap division by zero in case the operating system doesn't prevent
       it (Tom)
     * Change the numeric data type internally to base 10000 (Tom)
     * New hostmask() function (Greg Wickham)
     * Fixes for to_char() and to_timestamp() (Karel)
     * Allow functions that can take any argument data type and return any
       data type, using anyelement and anyarray (Joe)
       This allows the creation of functions that can work with any data
       type.
     * Arrays may now be specified as ARRAY[1,2,3],
       ARRAY[['a','b'],['c','d']], or ARRAY[ARRAY[ARRAY[2]]] (Joe)
     * Allow proper comparisons for arrays, including ORDER BY and
       DISTINCT support (Joe)
     * Allow indexes on array columns (Joe)
     * Allow array concatenation with || (Joe)
     * Allow WHERE qualification expr op ANY/SOME/ALL (array_expr) (Joe)
       This allows arrays to behave like a list of values, for purposes
       like SELECT * FROM tab WHERE col IN (array_val).
     * New array functions array_append, array_cat, array_lower,
       array_prepend, array_to_string, array_upper, string_to_array (Joe)
     * Allow user defined aggregates to use polymorphic functions (Joe)
     * Allow assignments to empty arrays (Joe)
     * Allow 60 in seconds fields of time, timestamp, and interval input
       values (Tom)
       Sixty-second values are needed for leap seconds.
     * Allow cidr data type to be cast to text (Tom)
     * Disallow invalid time zone names in SET TIMEZONE
     * Trim trailing spaces when char is cast to varchar or text (Tom)
     * Make float(p) measure the precision "p" in binary digits, not
       decimal digits (Tom)
     * Add IPv6 support to the inet and cidr data types (Michael Graff)
     * Add family() function to report whether address is IPv4 or IPv6
       (Michael Graff)
     * Have SHOW datestyle generate output similar to that used by SET
       datestyle (Tom)
     * Make EXTRACT(TIMEZONE) and SET/SHOW TIME ZONE follow the SQL
       convention for the sign of time zone offsets, i.e., positive is
       east from UTC (Tom)
     * Fix date_trunc('quarter', ...) (Böjthe Zoltán)
       Prior releases returned an incorrect value for this function call.
     * Make initcap() more compatible with Oracle (Mike Nolan)
       initcap() now uppercases a letter appearing after any
       non-alphanumeric character, rather than only after whitespace.
     * Allow only datestyle field order for date values not in ISO-8601
       format (Greg)
     * Add new datestyle values MDY, DMY, and YMD to set input field
       order; honor US and European for backward compatibility (Tom)
     * String literals like 'now' or 'today' will no longer work as a
       column default. Use functions such as now(), current_timestamp
       instead. (change required for prepared statements) (Tom)
     * Treat NaN as larger than any other value in min()/max() (Tom)
       NaN was already sorted after ordinary numeric values for most
       purposes, but min() and max() didn't get this right.
     * Prevent interval from suppressing :00 seconds display
     * New functions pg_get_triggerdef(prettyprint) and
       pg_conversion_is_visible() (Christopher)
     * Allow time to be specified as 040506 or 0405 (Tom)
     * Input date order must now be YYYY-MM-DD (with 4-digit year) or
       match datestyle
     * Make pg_get_constraintdef support unique, primary-key, and check
       constraints (Christopher)
     __________________________________________________________________

Server-Side Language Changes

     * Prevent PL/pgSQL crash when RETURN NEXT is used on a zero-row
       record variable (Tom)
     * Make PL/Python's spi_execute interface handle null values properly
       (Andrew Bosma)
     * Allow PL/pgSQL to declare variables of composite types without
       %ROWTYPE (Tom)
     * Fix PL/Python's _quote() function to handle big integers
     * Make PL/Python an untrusted language, now called plpythonu (Kevin
       Jacobs, Tom)
       The Python language no longer supports a restricted execution
       environment, so the trusted version of PL/Python was removed. If
       this situation changes, a version of PL/Python that can be used by
       non-superusers will be readded.
     * Allow polymorphic PL/pgSQL functions (Joe, Tom)
     * Allow polymorphic SQL functions (Joe)
     * Improved compiled function caching mechanism in PL/pgSQL with full
       support for polymorphism (Joe)
     * Add new parameter $0 in PL/pgSQL representing the function's actual
       return type (Joe)
     * Allow PL/Tcl and PL/Python to use the same trigger on multiple
       tables (Tom)
     * Fixed PL/Tcl's spi_prepare to accept fully qualified type names in
       the parameter type list (Jan)
     __________________________________________________________________

psql Changes

     * Add \pset pager always to always use pager (Greg)
       This forces the pager to be used even if the number of rows is less
       than the screen height. This is valuable for rows that wrap across
       several screen rows.
     * Improve tab completion (Rod, Ross Reedstrom, Ian Barwick)
     * Reorder \? help into groupings (Harald Armin Massa, Bruce)
     * Add backslash commands for listing schemas, casts, and conversions
       (Christopher)
     * "\encoding" now changes based on the server parameter
       client_encoding (Tom)
       In previous versions, "\encoding" was not aware of encoding changes
       made using SET client_encoding.
     * Save editor buffer into readline history (Ross)
       When "\e" is used to edit a query, the result is saved in the
       readline history for retrieval using the up arrow.
     * Improve "\d" display (Christopher)
     * Enhance HTML mode to be more standards-conforming (Greg)
     * New "\set AUTOCOMMIT off" capability (Tom)
       This takes the place of the removed server parameter autocommit.
     * New "\set VERBOSITY" to control error detail (Tom)
       This controls the new error reporting details.
     * New prompt escape sequence %x to show transaction status (Tom)
     * Long options for psql are now available on all platforms
     __________________________________________________________________

pg_dump Changes

     * Multiple pg_dump fixes, including tar format and large objects
     * Allow pg_dump to dump specific schemas (Neil)
     * Make pg_dump preserve column storage characteristics (Christopher)
       This preserves ALTER TABLE ... SET STORAGE information.
     * Make pg_dump preserve "CLUSTER" characteristics (Christopher)
     * Have pg_dumpall use "GRANT"/"REVOKE" to dump database-level
       privileges (Tom)
     * Allow pg_dumpall to support the options "-a", "-s", "-x" of pg_dump
       (Tom)
     * Prevent pg_dump from lowercasing identifiers specified on the
       command line (Tom)
     * pg_dump options "--use-set-session-authorization" and
       "--no-reconnect" now do nothing, all dumps use "SET SESSION
       AUTHORIZATION"
       pg_dump no longer reconnects to switch users, but instead always
       uses "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION". This will reduce password
       prompting during restores.
     * Long options for pg_dump are now available on all platforms
       PostgreSQL now includes its own long-option processing routines.
     __________________________________________________________________

libpq Changes

     * Add function PQfreemem for freeing memory on Windows, suggested for
       "NOTIFY" (Bruce)
       Windows requires that memory allocated in a library be freed by a
       function in the same library, hence free() doesn't work for freeing
       memory allocated by libpq. PQfreemem is the proper way to free
       libpq memory, especially on Windows, and is recommended for other
       platforms as well.
     * Document service capability, and add sample file (Bruce)
       This allows clients to look up connection information in a central
       file on the client machine.
     * Make PQsetdbLogin have the same defaults as PQconnectdb (Tom)
     * Allow libpq to cleanly fail when result sets are too large (Tom)
     * Improve performance of function PQunescapeBytea (Ben Lamb)
     * Allow thread-safe libpq with "configure" option
       "--enable-thread-safety" (Lee Kindness, Philip Yarra)
     * Allow function pqInternalNotice to accept a format string and
       arguments instead of just a preformatted message (Tom, Sean
       Chittenden)
     * Control SSL negotiation with sslmode values disable, allow, prefer,
       and require (Jon Jensen)
     * Allow new error codes and levels of text (Tom)
     * Allow access to the underlying table and column of a query result
       (Tom)
       This is helpful for query-builder applications that want to know
       the underlying table and column names associated with a specific
       result set.
     * Allow access to the current transaction status (Tom)
     * Add ability to pass binary data directly to the server (Tom)
     * Add function PQexecPrepared and PQsendQueryPrepared functions which
       perform bind/execute of previously prepared statements (Tom)
     __________________________________________________________________

JDBC Changes

     * Allow setNull on updateable result sets
     * Allow executeBatch on a prepared statement (Barry)
     * Support SSL connections (Barry)
     * Handle schema names in result sets (Paul Sorenson)
     * Add refcursor support (Nic Ferrier)
     __________________________________________________________________

Miscellaneous Interface Changes

     * Prevent possible memory leak or core dump during libpgtcl shutdown
       (Tom)
     * Add Informix compatibility to ECPG (Michael)
       This allows ECPG to process embedded C programs that were written
       using certain Informix extensions.
     * Add type decimal to ECPG that is fixed length, for Informix
       (Michael)
     * Allow thread-safe embedded SQL programs with "configure" option
       "--enable-thread-safety" (Lee Kindness, Bruce)
       This allows multiple threads to access the database at the same
       time.
     * Moved Python client PyGreSQL to http://www.pygresql.org (Marc)
     __________________________________________________________________

Source Code Changes

     * Prevent need for separate platform geometry regression result files
       (Tom)
     * Improved PPC locking primitive (Reinhard Max)
     * New function palloc0 to allocate and clear memory (Bruce)
     * Fix locking code for s390x CPU (64-bit) (Tom)
     * Allow OpenBSD to use local ident credentials (William Ahern)
     * Make query plan trees read-only to executor (Tom)
     * Add Darwin startup scripts (David Wheeler)
     * Allow libpq to compile with Borland C++ compiler (Lester Godwin,
       Karl Waclawek)
     * Use our own version of getopt_long() if needed (Peter)
     * Convert administration scripts to C (Peter)
     * Bison >= 1.85 is now required to build the PostgreSQL grammar, if
       building from CVS
     * Merge documentation into one book (Peter)
     * Add Windows compatibility functions (Bruce)
     * Allow client interfaces to compile under MinGW (Bruce)
     * New ereport() function for error reporting (Tom)
     * Support Intel compiler on Linux (Peter)
     * Improve Linux startup scripts (Slawomir Sudnik, Darko Prenosil)
     * Add support for AMD Opteron and Itanium (Jeffrey W. Baker, Bruce)
     * Remove "--enable-recode" option from "configure"
       This was no longer needed now that we have "CREATE CONVERSION".
     * Generate a compile error if spinlock code is not found (Bruce)
       Platforms without spinlock code will now fail to compile, rather
       than silently using semaphores. This failure can be disabled with a
       new "configure" option.
     __________________________________________________________________

Contrib Changes

     * Change dbmirror license to BSD
     * Improve earthdistance (Bruno Wolff III)
     * Portability improvements to pgcrypto (Marko Kreen)
     * Prevent crash in xml (John Gray, Michael Richards)
     * Update oracle
     * Update mysql
     * Update cube (Bruno Wolff III)
     * Update earthdistance to use cube (Bruno Wolff III)
     * Update btree_gist (Oleg)

       (Nabil Sayegh,Joe)
     * Add named persistent connections to dblink (Shridhar Daithanka)
     * New pg_autovacuum allows automatic "VACUUM" (Matthew T. O'Connor)
     * Make pgbench honor environment variables PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER
       (Tatsuo)

     * Improve adddepend (Rod)
     * Update spi/timetravel (Böjthe Zoltán)
     * Fix dbase "-s" option and improve non-ASCII handling (Thomas Behr,
       Márcio Smiderle)
     * Remove array module because features now included by default (Joe)

                               Release 7.3.15

     Release date: 2006-05-23

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.14, including patches
   for extremely serious security issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.15

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.13, see the release notes
   for 7.3.13.

   Full security against the SQL-injection attacks described in
   CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 may require changes in application
   code. If you have applications that embed untrustworthy strings into
   SQL commands, you should examine them as soon as possible to ensure
   that they are using recommended escaping techniques. In most cases,
   applications should be using subroutines provided by libraries or
   drivers (such as libpq's PQescapeStringConn()) to perform string
   escaping, rather than relying on ad hoc code to do it.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change the server to reject invalidly-encoded multibyte characters
       in all cases (Tatsuo, Tom)
       While PostgreSQL has been moving in this direction for some time,
       the checks are now applied uniformly to all encodings and all
       textual input, and are now always errors not merely warnings. This
       change defends against SQL-injection attacks of the type described
       in CVE-2006-2313.
     * Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals
       As a server-side defense against SQL-injection attacks of the type
       described in CVE-2006-2314, the server now only accepts '' and not
       \' as a representation of ASCII single quote in SQL string
       literals. By default, \' is rejected only when client_encoding is
       set to a client-only encoding (SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC),
       which is the scenario in which SQL injection is possible. A new
       configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
       behavior when needed. Note that full security against CVE-2006-2314
       may require client-side changes; the purpose of backslash_quote is
       in part to make it obvious that insecure clients are insecure.
     * Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
       considerations
       This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
       described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314. Applications that use
       multiple PostgreSQL connections concurrently should migrate to
       PQescapeStringConn() and PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that
       escaping is done correctly for the settings in use in each database
       connection. Applications that do string escaping "by hand" should
       be modified to rely on library routines instead.
     * Fix some incorrect encoding conversion functions
       win1251_to_iso, alt_to_iso, euc_tw_to_big5, euc_tw_to_mic,
       mic_to_euc_tw were all broken to varying extents.
     * Clean up stray remaining uses of \' in strings (Bruce, Jan)
     * Fix server to use custom DH SSL parameters correctly (Michael Fuhr)
     * Fix various minor memory leaks

     Release date: 2006-02-14

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.14

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you

   for 7.3.13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix potential crash in "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" (CVE-2006-0553)
       An unprivileged user could crash the server process, resulting in
       momentary denial of service to other users, if the server has been
       compiled with Asserts enabled (which is not the default). Thanks to
       Akio Ishida for reporting this problem.
     * Fix bug with row visibility logic in self-inserted rows (Tom)
       Under rare circumstances a row inserted by the current command
       could be seen as already valid, when it should not be. Repairs bug
       created in 7.3.11 release.
     * Fix race condition that could lead to "file already exists" errors
       during pg_clog file creation (Tom)
     * Fix to allow restoring dumps that have cross-schema references to
       custom operators (Tom)
     * Portability fix for testing presence of finite and isinf during
       configure (Tom)

                               Release 7.3.13

     Release date: 2006-01-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.12.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.13

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.10, see the release notes
   for 7.3.10. Also, you might need to "REINDEX" indexes on textual
   columns after updating, if you are affected by the locale or plperl
   issues described below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
       character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian (Tom)
       This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
       columns.
     * Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
       ensure that plperl won't change the locale later
       This fixes a problem that occurred if the postmaster was started
       with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
       initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
       likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You may need "REINDEX" to fix
       existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
     * Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
       certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets (Tatsuo)
     * Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
       all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms (Marko Kreen,
       Solar Designer)
       Salts for Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
     * Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
       the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
       returned by the query (Joe)

                               Release 7.3.12

     Release date: 2005-12-12

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.12

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.10, see the release notes
   for 7.3.10.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix race condition in transaction log management
       There was a narrow window in which an I/O operation could be
       initiated for the wrong page, leading to an Assert failure or data
       corruption.
     * "/contrib/ltree" fixes (Teodor)
     * Fix longstanding planning error for outer joins
       This bug sometimes caused a bogus error "RIGHT JOIN is only
       supported with merge-joinable join conditions".
     * Prevent core dump in pg_autovacuum when a table has been dropped

                               Release 7.3.11

     Release date: 2005-10-04

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.10.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.11

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, if you
   are upgrading from a version earlier than 7.3.10, see the release notes
   for 7.3.10.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Fix error that allowed "VACUUM" to remove ctid chains too soon, and
       add more checking in code that follows ctid links
       This fixes a long-standing problem that could cause crashes in very
       rare circumstances.
     * Fix CHAR() to properly pad spaces to the specified length when
       using a multiple-byte character set (Yoshiyuki Asaba)
       In prior releases, the padding of CHAR() was incorrect because it
       only padded to the specified number of bytes without considering
       how many characters were stored.
     * Fix missing rows in queries like UPDATE a=... WHERE a... with GiST
       index on column a
     * Improve checking for partially-written WAL pages
     * Improve robustness of signal handling when SSL is enabled
     * Various memory leakage fixes
     * Various portability improvements
     * Fix PL/PgSQL to handle var := var correctly when the variable is of
       pass-by-reference type
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Release 7.3.10

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.9, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.10

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X. However, it is
   one possible way of handling a significant security problem that has
   been found in the initial contents of 7.3.X system catalogs. A
   dump/initdb/reload sequence using 7.3.10's initdb will automatically
   correct this problem.

   The security problem is that the built-in character set encoding
   conversion functions can be invoked from SQL commands by unprivileged
   users, but the functions were not designed for such use and are not
   secure against malicious choices of arguments. The fix involves
   changing the declared parameter list of these functions so that they
   can no longer be invoked from SQL commands. (This does not affect their
   normal use by the encoding conversion machinery.) It is strongly
   recommended that all installations repair this error, either by initdb
   or by following the manual repair procedure given below. The error at
   least allows unprivileged database users to crash their server process,
   and may allow unprivileged users to gain the privileges of a database
   superuser.

   If you wish not to do an initdb, perform the following procedure
   instead. As the database superuser, do:
BEGIN;
UPDATE pg_proc SET proargtypes[3] = 'internal'::regtype
WHERE pronamespace = 11 AND pronargs = 5
      AND proargtypes[2] = 'cstring'::regtype;
-- The command should report having updated 90 rows;
-- if not, rollback and investigate instead of committing!
COMMIT;

   The above procedure must be carried out in *each* database of an
   installation, including template1, and ideally including template0 as
   well. If you do not fix the template databases then any subsequently
   created databases will contain the same error. template1 can be fixed
   in the same way as any other database, but fixing template0 requires
   additional steps. First, from any database issue
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';

   Next connect to template0 and perform the above repair procedure.
   Finally, do
-- re-freeze template0:
VACUUM FREEZE;
-- and protect it against future alterations:
UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Change encoding function signature to prevent misuse
     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix comparisons of TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
       The comparison code was wrong in the case where the
       --enable-integer-datetimes configuration switch had been used.
       NOTE: if you have an index on a TIME WITH TIME ZONE column, it will
       need to be "REINDEX"ed after installing this update, because the
       fix corrects the sort order of column values.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Fix mis-display of negative fractional seconds in INTERVAL values
       This error only occurred when the --enable-integer-datetimes
       configuration switch had been used.
     * Additional buffer overrun checks in plpgsql (Neil)
     * Fix pg_dump to dump trigger names containing % correctly (Neil)
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from dumping core for month-related
       formats
     * Fix "contrib/pgcrypto" for newer OpenSSL builds (Marko Kreen)
     * Still more 64-bit fixes for "contrib/intagg"
     * Prevent incorrect optimization of functions returning RECORD
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.3.9

     Release date: 2005-01-31

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.8, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.9

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Check that creator of an aggregate function has the right to
       execute the specified transition functions
       This oversight made it possible to bypass denial of EXECUTE
       permission on a function.
     * Fix security and 64-bit issues in contrib/intagg
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Fix plperl for quote marks in tuple fields
     * Fix display of negative intervals in SQL and GERMAN datestyles
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.3.8

     Release date: 2004-10-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.3.7.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair possible failure to update hint bits on disk
       Under rare circumstances this oversight could lead to "could not
       access transaction status" failures, which qualifies it as a
       potential-data-loss bug.
     * Ensure that hashed outer join does not miss tuples
       Very large left joins using a hash join plan could fail to output
       unmatched left-side rows given just the right data distribution.
     * Disallow running pg_ctl as root
       This is to guard against any possible security issues.
     * Avoid using temp files in /tmp in make_oidjoins_check
       This has been reported as a security issue, though it's hardly
       worthy of concern since there is no reason for non-developers to
       use this script anyway.

                                Release 7.3.7

     Release date: 2004-08-16

   This release contains one critical fix over 7.3.6, and some minor
   items.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.3.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent possible loss of committed transactions during crash
       Due to insufficient interlocking between transaction commit and
       checkpointing, it was possible for transactions committed just
       before the most recent checkpoint to be lost, in whole or in part,
       following a database crash and restart. This is a serious bug that
       has existed since PostgreSQL 7.1.
     * Remove asymmetrical word processing in tsearch (Teodor)
     * Properly schema-qualify function names when pg_dump'ing a CAST

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.6

   A dump/restore is *not* required for those running 7.3.*.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Revert erroneous changes in rule permissions checking
       A patch applied in 7.3.3 to fix a corner case in rule permissions
       checks turns out to have disabled rule-related permissions checks
       in many not-so-corner cases. This would for example allow users to
       insert into views they weren't supposed to have permission to
       insert into. We have therefore reverted the 7.3.3 patch. The
       original bug will be fixed in 8.0.
     * Repair incorrect order of operations in GetNewTransactionId()
       This bug could result in failure under out-of-disk-space
       conditions, including inability to restart even after disk space is
       freed.
     * Ensure configure selects -fno-strict-aliasing even when an external
       value for CFLAGS is supplied
       On some platforms, building with -fstrict-aliasing causes bugs.
     * Make pg_restore handle 64-bit off_t correctly
       This bug prevented proper restoration from archive files exceeding
       4Gb.
     * Make contrib/dblink not assume that local and remote type OIDs
       match (Joe)
     * Quote connectby()'s start_with argument properly (Joe)
     * Don't crash when a rowtype argument to a plpgsql function is NULL
     * Avoid generating invalid character encoding sequences in corner
       cases when planning LIKE operations
     * Ensure text_position() cannot scan past end of source string in
       multibyte cases (Korea PostgreSQL Users' Group)
     * Fix index optimization and selectivity estimates for LIKE
       operations on bytea columns (Joe)

       Ranganathan)
     * Fix problems with dropped columns in plpython triggers
     * Repair problems with to_char() reading past end of its input string
       (Karel)
     * Fix GB18030 mapping errors (Tatsuo)
     * Fix several problems with SSL error handling and asynchronous SSL
       I/O
     * Remove ability to bind a list of values to a single parameter in
       JDBC (prevents possible SQL-injection attacks)

                                Release 7.3.1

     Release date: 2002-12-18

   This release contains a variety of fixes for version 7.3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3.1

   A dump/restore is *not* required for those running version 7.3.
   However, it should be noted that the main PostgreSQL interface library,
   libpq, has a new major version number for this release, which may
   require recompilation of client code in certain cases.

                                 Release 7.3

     Release date: 2002-11-27
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   Major changes in this release:

   Schemas
          Schemas allow users to create objects in separate namespaces, so
          two people or applications can have tables with the same name.
          There is also a public schema for shared tables. Table/index
          creation can be restricted by removing privileges on the public
          schema.

   Drop Column
          PostgreSQL now supports the ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN
          functionality.

   Table Functions
          Functions returning multiple rows and/or multiple columns are
          now much easier to use than before. You can call such a "table
          function" in the SELECT FROM clause, treating its output like a
          table. Also, PL/pgSQL functions can now return sets.

   Prepared Queries
          PostgreSQL now supports prepared queries, for improved
          performance.

   Dependency Tracking
          PostgreSQL now records object dependencies, which allows
          improvements in many areas. "DROP" statements now take either
          CASCADE or RESTRICT to control whether dependent objects are
          also dropped.

   Privileges
          Functions and procedural languages now have privileges, and
          functions can be defined to run with the privileges of their
          creator.

   Internationalization
          Both multibyte and locale support are now always enabled.

   Logging
          A variety of logging options have been enhanced.

   Interfaces
          A large number of interfaces have been moved to
          http://gborg.postgresql.org where they can be developed and
          released independently.

   Functions/Identifiers
          By default, functions can now take up to 32 parameters, and
          identifiers can be up to 63 bytes long. Also, OPAQUE is now
          deprecated: there are specific "pseudo-datatypes" to represent
          each of the former meanings of OPAQUE in function argument and
          result types.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.3

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release. If your application examines the system
   catalogs, additional changes will be required due to the introduction
   of schemas in 7.3; for more information, see:
   http://developer.postgresql.org/~momjian/upgrade_tips_7.3.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * Pre-6.3 clients are no longer supported.
     * "pg_hba.conf" now has a column for the user name and additional
       features. Existing files need to be adjusted.
     * Several "postgresql.conf" logging parameters have been renamed.
     * LIMIT #,# has been disabled; use LIMIT # OFFSET #.
     * "INSERT" statements with column lists must specify a value for each
       specified column. For example, INSERT INTO tab (col1, col2) VALUES
       ('val1') is now invalid. It's still allowed to supply fewer columns
       than expected if the "INSERT" does not have a column list.
     * serial columns are no longer automatically UNIQUE; thus, an index
       will not automatically be created.
     * A "SET" command inside an aborted transaction is now rolled back.
     * "COPY" no longer considers missing trailing columns to be null. All
       columns need to be specified. (However, one may achieve a similar
       effect by specifying a column list in the "COPY" command.)
     * The data type timestamp is now equivalent to timestamp without time
       zone, instead of timestamp with time zone.
     * Pre-7.3 databases loaded into 7.3 will not have the new object
       dependencies for serial columns, unique constraints, and foreign
       keys. See the directory "contrib/adddepend/" for a detailed
       description and a script that will add such dependencies.
     * An empty string ('') is no longer allowed as the input into an
       integer field. Formerly, it was silently interpreted as 0.

                                Release 7.2.8

     Release date: 2005-05-09

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.7, including one
   security-related issue.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.2.8

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair ancient race condition that allowed a transaction to be seen
       as committed for some purposes (eg SELECT FOR UPDATE) slightly
       sooner than for other purposes
       This is an extremely serious bug since it could lead to apparent
       data inconsistencies being briefly visible to applications.
     * Repair race condition between relation extension and VACUUM
       This could theoretically have caused loss of a page's worth of
       freshly-inserted data, although the scenario seems of very low
       probability. There are no known cases of it having caused more than
       an Assert failure.
     * Fix EXTRACT(EPOCH) for TIME WITH TIME ZONE values
     * Additional buffer overrun checks in plpgsql (Neil)
     * Fix pg_dump to dump index names and trigger names containing %
       correctly (Neil)
     * Prevent to_char(interval) from dumping core for month-related
       formats
     * Fix "contrib/pgcrypto" for newer OpenSSL builds (Marko Kreen)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.2.7

     Release date: 2005-01-31

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.6, including several
   security-related issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.2.7

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Disallow "LOAD" to non-superusers
       On platforms that will automatically execute initialization
       functions of a shared library (this includes at least Windows and
       ELF-based Unixen), "LOAD" can be used to make the server execute
       arbitrary code. Thanks to NGS Software for reporting this.
     * Add needed STRICT marking to some contrib functions (Kris Jurka)
     * Avoid buffer overrun when plpgsql cursor declaration has too many
       parameters (Neil)
     * Fix planning error for FULL and RIGHT outer joins
       The result of the join was mistakenly supposed to be sorted the
       same as the left input. This could not only deliver mis-sorted
       output to the user, but in case of nested merge joins could give
       outright wrong answers.
     * Fix display of negative intervals in SQL and GERMAN datestyles
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.2.6

     Release date: 2004-10-22

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.2.6

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Repair possible failure to update hint bits on disk
       Under rare circumstances this oversight could lead to "could not
       access transaction status" failures, which qualifies it as a
       potential-data-loss bug.
     * Ensure that hashed outer join does not miss tuples
       Very large left joins using a hash join plan could fail to output
       unmatched left-side rows given just the right data distribution.
     * Disallow running pg_ctl as root
       This is to guard against any possible security issues.
     * Avoid using temp files in /tmp in make_oidjoins_check
       This has been reported as a security issue, though it's hardly
       worthy of concern since there is no reason for non-developers to
       use this script anyway.
     * Update to newer versions of Bison
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Release 7.2.5

     Release date: 2004-08-16

   This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.2.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.2.5

   A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.2.X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

     * Prevent possible loss of committed transactions during crash
       Due to insufficient interlocking between transaction commit and
       checkpointing, it was possible for transactions committed just
       before the most recent checkpoint to be lost, in whole or in part,
       following a database crash and restart. This is a serious bug that
       has existed since PostgreSQL 7.1.
     * Fix corner case for btree search in parallel with first root page
       split
     * Fix buffer overrun in to_ascii (Guido Notari)
     * Fix core dump in deadlock detection on machines where char is
       unsigned
     * Fix failure to respond to "pg_ctl stop -m fast" after
       Async_NotifyHandler runs
     * Repair memory leaks in pg_dump
     * Avoid conflict with system definition of isblank() function or
       macro

       error
     * Prevent VACUUM from being called inside a function (Bruce)
     * Ensure pg_clog updates are sync'd to disk before marking checkpoint
       complete
     * Avoid integer overflow during large hash joins
     * Make GROUP commands work when pg_group.grolist is large enough to
       be toasted
     * Fix errors in datetime tables; some timezone names weren't being
       recognized
     * Fix integer overflows in circle_poly(), path_encode(), path_add()
       (Neil)
     * Repair long-standing logic errors in lseg_eq(), lseg_ne(),
       lseg_center()

     Release date: 2002-02-04
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   This release improves PostgreSQL for use in high-volume applications.

   Major changes in this release:

   VACUUM
          Vacuuming no longer locks tables, thus allowing normal user
          access during the vacuum. A new "VACUUM FULL" command does
          old-style vacuum by locking the table and shrinking the on-disk
          copy of the table.

   Transactions
          There is no longer a problem with installations that exceed four
          billion transactions.

   OIDs
          OIDs are now optional. Users can now create tables without OIDs
          for cases where OID usage is excessive.

   Optimizer
          The system now computes histogram column statistics during
          "ANALYZE", allowing much better optimizer choices.

   Security
          A new MD5 encryption option allows more secure storage and
          transfer of passwords. A new Unix-domain socket authentication
          option is available on Linux and BSD systems.

   Statistics
          Administrators can use the new table access statistics module to
          get fine-grained information about table and index usage.

   Internationalization
          Program and library messages can now be displayed in several
          languages.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.2

   A dump/restore using "pg_dump" is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

   Observe the following incompatibilities:

     * The semantics of the "VACUUM" command have changed in this release.
       You may wish to update your maintenance procedures accordingly.
     * In this release, comparisons using = NULL will always return false
       (or NULL, more precisely). Previous releases automatically
       transformed this syntax to IS NULL. The old behavior can be
       re-enabled using a "postgresql.conf" parameter.
     * The "pg_hba.conf" and "pg_ident.conf" configuration is now only
       reloaded after receiving a SIGHUP signal, not with each connection.
     * The function "octet_length()" now returns the uncompressed data
       length.
     * The date/time value 'current' is no longer available. You will need
       to rewrite your applications.
     * The timestamp(), time(), and interval() functions are no longer
       available. Instead of timestamp(), use timestamp 'string' or CAST.

   The SELECT ... LIMIT #,# syntax will be removed in the next release.
   You should change your queries to use separate LIMIT and OFFSET
   clauses, e.g. LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20.

                                 Release 7.1

     Release date: 2001-04-13

   This release focuses on removing limitations that have existed in the
   PostgreSQL code for many years.

   Major changes in this release:

   Write-ahead Log (WAL)
          To maintain database consistency in case of an operating system
          crash, previous releases of PostgreSQL have forced all data
          modifications to disk before each transaction commit. With WAL,
          only one log file must be flushed to disk, greatly improving
          performance. If you have been using -F in previous releases to
          disable disk flushes, you may want to consider discontinuing its
          use.

   TOAST
          TOAST - Previous releases had a compiled-in row length limit,
          typically 8k - 32k. This limit made storage of long text fields
          difficult. With TOAST, long rows of any length can be stored
          with good performance.

   Outer Joins
          We now support outer joins. The UNION/NOT IN workaround for
          outer joins is no longer required. We use the SQL92 outer join
          syntax.

   Function Manager
          The previous C function manager did not handle null values
          properly, nor did it support 64-bit CPU's (Alpha). The new
          function manager does. You can continue using your old custom
          functions, but you may want to rewrite them in the future to use
          the new function manager call interface.

   Complex Queries
          A large number of complex queries that were unsupported in
          previous releases now work. Many combinations of views,
          aggregates, UNION, LIMIT, cursors, subqueries, and inherited
          tables now work properly. Inherited tables are now accessed by
          default. Subqueries in FROM are now supported.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.1

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release.

     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Release 7.0

     Release date: 2000-05-08

   This release contains improvements in many areas, demonstrating the
   continued growth of PostgreSQL. There are more improvements and fixes
   in 7.0 than in any previous release. The developers have confidence
   that this is the best release yet; we do our best to put out only solid
   releases, and this one is no exception.

   Major changes in this release:

   Foreign Keys
          Foreign keys are now implemented, with the exception of PARTIAL
          MATCH foreign keys. Many users have been asking for this
          feature, and we are pleased to offer it.

   Optimizer Overhaul
          Continuing on work started a year ago, the optimizer has been
          improved, allowing better query plan selection and faster
          performance with less memory usage.

   Updated psql
          psql, our interactive terminal monitor, has been updated with a
          variety of new features. See the psql manual page for details.

   Join Syntax
          SQL92 join syntax is now supported, though only as INNER JOIN
          for this release. JOIN, NATURAL JOIN, JOIN/USING, and JOIN/ON
          are available, as are column correlation names.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 7.0

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release of PostgreSQL. For those upgrading from
   6.5.*, you may instead use pg_upgrade to upgrade to this release;
   however, a full dump/reload installation is always the most robust
   method for upgrades.

   Interface and compatibility issues to consider for the new release
   include:

     * The date/time types datetime and timespan have been superseded by
       the SQL92-defined types timestamp and interval. Although there has
       been some effort to ease the transition by allowing PostgreSQL to
       recognize the deprecated type names and translate them to the new
       type names, this mechanism may not be completely transparent to
       your existing application.
     * The optimizer has been substantially improved in the area of query
       cost estimation. In some cases, this will result in decreased query
       times as the optimizer makes a better choice for the preferred
       plan. However, in a small number of cases, usually involving
       pathological distributions of data, your query times may go up. If
       you are dealing with large amounts of data, you may want to check
       your queries to verify performance.
     * The JDBC and ODBC interfaces have been upgraded and extended.
     * The string function CHAR_LENGTH is now a native function. Previous
       versions translated this into a call to LENGTH, which could result
       in ambiguity with other types implementing LENGTH such as the
       geometric types.

                                 Release 6.5

     Release date: 1999-06-09

   This release marks a major step in the development team's mastery of
   the source code we inherited from Berkeley. You will see we are now
   easily adding major features, thanks to the increasing size and
   experience of our world-wide development team.

   Here is a brief summary of the more notable changes:

   Multiversion concurrency control(MVCC)
          This removes our old table-level locking, and replaces it with a
          locking system that is superior to most commercial database
          systems. In a traditional system, each row that is modified is
          locked until committed, preventing reads by other users. MVCC
          uses the natural multiversion nature of PostgreSQL to allow
          readers to continue reading consistent data during writer
          activity. Writers continue to use the compact pg_log transaction
          system. This is all performed without having to allocate a lock
          for every row like traditional database systems. So, basically,
          we no longer are restricted by simple table-level locking; we
          have something better than row-level locking.

   Hot backups from pg_dump
          pg_dump takes advantage of the new MVCC features to give a
          consistent database dump/backup while the database stays online
          and available for queries.

   Numeric data type
          We now have a true numeric data type, with user-specified
          precision.

   Temporary tables
          Temporary tables are guaranteed to have unique names within a
          database session, and are destroyed on session exit.

   New SQL features
          We now have CASE, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT statement support. We
          have new LIMIT/OFFSET, SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL, SELECT
          ... FOR UPDATE, and an improved LOCK TABLE command.

   Speedups
          We continue to speed up PostgreSQL, thanks to the variety of
          talents within our team. We have sped up memory allocation,
          optimization, table joins, and row transfer routines.

   Ports
          We continue to expand our port list, this time including Windows
          NT/ix86 and NetBSD/arm32.

   Interfaces
          Most interfaces have new versions, and existing functionality
          has been improved.

   Documentation
          New and updated material is present throughout the
          documentation. New FAQs have been contributed for SGI and AIX
          platforms. The Tutorial has introductory information on SQL from
          Stefan Simkovics. For the User's Guide, there are reference
          pages covering the postmaster and more utility programs, and a
          new appendix contains details on date/time behavior. The
          Administrator's Guide has a new chapter on troubleshooting from
          Tom Lane. And the Programmer's Guide has a description of query
          processing, also from Stefan, and details on obtaining the
          PostgreSQL source tree via anonymous CVS and CVSup.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 6.5

   A dump/restore using pg_dump is required for those wishing to migrate
   data from any previous release of PostgreSQL. pg_upgrade can *not* be
   used to upgrade to this release because the on-disk structure of the
   tables has changed compared to previous releases.

   The new Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) features can give
   somewhat different behaviors in multiuser environments. *Read and
   understand the following section to ensure that your existing
   applications will give you the behavior you need.*
     __________________________________________________________________

Multiversion Concurrency Control

   Because readers in 6.5 don't lock data, regardless of transaction
   isolation level, data read by one transaction can be overwritten by
   another. In other words, if a row is returned by "SELECT" it doesn't
   mean that this row really exists at the time it is returned (i.e.
   sometime after the statement or transaction began) nor that the row is
   protected from being deleted or updated by concurrent transactions
   before the current transaction does a commit or rollback.

   To ensure the actual existence of a row and protect it against
   concurrent updates one must use "SELECT FOR UPDATE" or an appropriate
   "LOCK TABLE" statement. This should be taken into account when porting
   applications from previous releases of PostgreSQL and other
   environments.

   Keep the above in mind if you are using "contrib/refint.*" triggers for
   referential integrity. Additional techniques are required now. One way
   is to use "LOCK parent_table IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE" command if a
   transaction is going to update/delete a primary key and use "LOCK
   parent_table IN SHARE MODE" command if a transaction is going to
   update/insert a foreign key.

     Note: Note that if you run a transaction in SERIALIZABLE mode then
     you must execute the "LOCK" commands above before execution of any
     DML statement ("SELECT/INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE/FETCH/COPY_TO") in the
     transaction.

   These inconveniences will disappear in the future when the ability to
   read dirty (uncommitted) data (regardless of isolation level) and true
   referential integrity will be implemented.

                                 Release 6.4

     Release date: 1998-10-30

   There are *many* new features and improvements in this release. Thanks
   to our developers and maintainers, nearly every aspect of the system
   has received some attention since the previous release. Here is a
   brief, incomplete summary:

     * Views and rules are now functional thanks to extensive new code in
       the rewrite rules system from Jan Wieck. He also wrote a chapter on
       it for the Programmer's Guide.
     * Jan also contributed a second procedural language, PL/pgSQL, to go
       with the original PL/pgTCL procedural language he contributed last
       release.
     * We have optional multiple-byte character set support from Tatsuo
       Ishii to complement our existing locale support.
     * Client/server communications has been cleaned up, with better
       support for asynchronous messages and interrupts thanks to Tom
       Lane.
     * The parser will now perform automatic type coercion to match
       arguments to available operators and functions, and to match
       columns and expressions with target columns. This uses a generic
       mechanism which supports the type extensibility features of
       PostgreSQL. There is a new chapter in the User's Guide which covers
       this topic.
     * Three new data types have been added. Two types, inet and cidr,
       support various forms of IP network, subnet, and machine
       addressing. There is now an 8-byte integer type available on some
       platforms. See the chapter on data types in the User's Guide for
       details. A fourth type, serial, is now supported by the parser as
       an amalgam of the int4 type, a sequence, and a unique index.
     * Several more SQL92-compatible syntax features have been added,
       including "INSERT DEFAULT VALUES"
     * The automatic configuration and installation system has received
       some attention, and should be more robust for more platforms than
       it has ever been.

                                Release 6.3.2

     Release date: 1998-04-07

   This is a bug-fix release for 6.3.x. Refer to the release notes for
   version 6.3 for a more complete summary of new features.

   Summary:

     * Repairs automatic configuration support for some platforms,
       including Linux, from breakage inadvertently introduced in version
       6.3.1.
     * Correctly handles function calls on the left side of BETWEEN and
       LIKE clauses.

   A dump/restore is NOT required for those running 6.3 or 6.3.1. A make
   distclean, make, and make install is all that is required. This last
   step should be performed while the postmaster is not running. You
   should re-link any custom applications that use PostgreSQL libraries.

   For upgrades from pre-6.3 installations, refer to the installation and
   migration instructions for version 6.3.

                                 Release 6.3

     Release date: 1998-03-01

   There are *many* new features and improvements in this release. Here is
   a brief, incomplete summary:

     * Many new SQL features, including full SQL92 subselect capability
       (everything is here but target-list subselects).
     * Support for client-side environment variables to specify time zone
       and date style.
     * Socket interface for client/server connection. This is the default
       now so you may need to start postmaster with the "-i" flag.
     * Better password authorization mechanisms. Default table privileges
       have changed.
     * Old-style time travel has been removed. Performance has been
       improved.

     Note: Bruce Momjian wrote the following notes to introduce the new
     release.

   There are some general 6.3 issues that I want to mention. These are
   only the big items that cannot be described in one sentence. A review
   of the detailed changes list is still needed.

   First, we now have subselects. Now that we have them, I would like to
   mention that without subselects, SQL is a very limited language.
   Subselects are a major feature, and you should review your code for
   places where subselects provide a better solution for your queries. I
   think you will find that there are more uses for subselects than you
   may think. Vadim has put us on the big SQL map with subselects, and
   fully functional ones too. The only thing you can't do with subselects
   is to use them in the target list.

   Second, 6.3 uses Unix domain sockets rather than TCP/IP by default. To
   enable connections from other machines, you have to use the new
   postmaster -i option, and of course edit "pg_hba.conf". Also, for this
   reason, the format of "pg_hba.conf" has changed.

   Third, char() fields will now allow faster access than varchar() or
   text. Specifically, the text and varchar() have a penalty for access to
   any columns after the first column of this type. char() used to also
   have this access penalty, but it no longer does. This may suggest that
   you redesign some of your tables, especially if you have short
   character columns that you have defined as varchar() or text. This and
   other changes make 6.3 even faster than earlier releases.

   We now have passwords definable independent of any Unix file. There are
   new SQL USER commands. See the Administrator's Guide for more
   information. There is a new table, pg_shadow, which is used to store
   user information and user passwords, and it by default only SELECT-able
   by the postgres super-user. pg_user is now a view of pg_shadow, and is
   SELECT-able by PUBLIC. You should keep using pg_user in your
   application without changes.

   User-created tables now no longer have SELECT privilege to PUBLIC by
   default. This was done because the ANSI standard requires it. You can
   of course GRANT any privileges you want after the table is created.
   System tables continue to be SELECT-able by PUBLIC.

   We also have real deadlock detection code. No more sixty-second
   timeouts. And the new locking code implements a FIFO better, so there
   should be less resource starvation during heavy use.

   Many complaints have been made about inadequate documentation in
   previous releases. Thomas has put much effort into many new manuals for
   this release. Check out the doc/ directory.

   For performance reasons, time travel is gone, but can be implemented
   using triggers (see "pgsql/contrib/spi/README"). Please check out the
   new \d command for types, operators, etc. Also, views have their own
   privileges now, not based on the underlying tables, so privileges on
   them have to be set separately. Check "/pgsql/interfaces" for some new
   ways to talk to PostgreSQL.

   This is the first release that really required an explanation for
   existing users. In many ways, this was necessary because the new
   release removes many limitations, and the work-arounds people were
   using are no longer needed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration to version 6.3

   A dump/restore using pg_dump or pg_dumpall is required for those
   wishing to migrate data from any previous release of PostgreSQL.

                                Release 6.2.1

     Release date: 1997-10-17

   6.2.1 is a bug-fix and usability release on 6.2.

   Summary:

     * Allow strings to span lines, per SQL92.
     * Include example trigger function for inserting user names on table
       updates.

   This is a minor bug-fix release on 6.2. For upgrades from pre-6.2
   systems, a full dump/reload is required. Refer to the 6.2 release notes
   for instructions.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 6.2 to version 6.2.1

   This is a minor bug-fix release. A dump/reload is not required from
   version 6.2, but is required from any release prior to 6.2.

   In upgrading from version 6.2, if you choose to dump/reload you will
   find that avg(money) is now calculated correctly. All other bug fixes
   take effect upon updating the executables.

   Another way to avoid dump/reload is to use the following SQL command
   from "psql" to update the existing system table:
  update pg_aggregate set aggfinalfn = 'cash_div_flt8'
   where aggname = 'avg' and aggbasetype = 790;

   This will need to be done to every existing database, including
   template1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Allow TIME and TYPE column names(Thomas)
Allow larger range of true/false as boolean values(Thomas)
Support output of "now" and "current"(Thomas)
Handle DEFAULT with INSERT of NULL properly(Vadim)
Fix for relation reference counts problem in buffer manager(Vadim)
Allow strings to span lines, like ANSI(Thomas)
Fix for backward cursor with ORDER BY(Vadim)
Fix avg(cash) computation(Thomas)
Fix for specifying a column twice in ORDER/GROUP BY(Vadim)
Documented new libpq function to return affected rows, PQcmdTuples(Bruce)
Trigger function for inserting user names for INSERT/UPDATE(Brook Milligan)
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Release 6.2

     Release date: 1997-10-02

   A dump/restore is required for those wishing to migrate data from
   previous releases of PostgreSQL.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 6.1 to version 6.2

   This migration requires a complete dump of the 6.1 database and a
   restore of the database in 6.2.

   Note that the "pg_dump" and "pg_dumpall" utility from 6.2 should be
   used to dump the 6.1 database.
     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 1.x to version 6.2

   Those migrating from earlier 1.* releases should first upgrade to 1.09
   because the COPY output format was improved from the 1.02 release.

   to the native set of PostgreSQL types. Points, boxes, paths, and
   polygons have had their output formats made consistent across the data
   types. The polygon output in misc.out has only been spot-checked for
   correctness relative to the original regression output.

   PostgreSQL 6.1 introduces a new, alternate optimizer which uses genetic
   algorithms. These algorithms introduce a random behavior in the
   ordering of query results when the query contains multiple qualifiers
   or multiple tables (giving the optimizer a choice on order of
   evaluation). Several regression tests have been modified to explicitly
   order the results, and hence are insensitive to optimizer choices. A
   few regression tests are for data types which are inherently unordered
   (e.g. points and time intervals) and tests involving those types are
   explicitly bracketed with "set geqo to 'off'" and "reset geqo".

   The interpretation of array specifiers (the curly braces around atomic
   values) appears to have changed sometime after the original regression
   tests were generated. The current "./expected/*.out" files reflect this
   new interpretation, which may not be correct!

   The float8 regression test fails on at least some platforms. This is
   due to differences in implementations of pow() and exp() and the
   signaling mechanisms used for overflow and underflow conditions.

   The "random" results in the random test should cause the "random" test
   to be "failed", since the regression tests are evaluated using a simple
   diff. However, "random" does not seem to produce random results on my
   test machine (Linux/gcc/i686).

Migration to version 6.1

   This migration requires a complete dump of the 6.0 database and a
   restore of the database in 6.1.

   Those migrating from earlier 1.* releases should first upgrade to 1.09
   because the COPY output format was improved from the 1.02 release.

   releases.
     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________

Migration from version 1.02 to version 1.02.1

   Here is a new migration file for 1.02.1. It includes the 'copy' change
   and a script to convert old ASCII files.

     Note: The following notes are for the benefit of users who want to
     migrate databases from Postgres95 1.01 and 1.02 to Postgres95
     1.02.1.

     If you are starting afresh with Postgres95 1.02.1 and do not need to
     migrate old databases, you do not need to read any further.

   In order to upgrade older Postgres95 version 1.01 or 1.02 databases to
   version 1.02.1, the following steps are required:
    1. Start up a new 1.02.1 postmaster
    2. Add the new built-in functions and operators of 1.02.1 to 1.01 or
       1.02 databases. This is done by running the new 1.02.1 server
       against your own 1.01 or 1.02 database and applying the queries
       attached at the end of the file. This can be done easily through
       "psql". If your 1.01 or 1.02 database is named testdb and you have
       cut the commands from the end of this file and saved them in
       "addfunc.sql":
        % psql testdb -f addfunc.sql
       Those upgrading 1.02 databases will get a warning when executing
       the last two statements in the file because they are already
       present in 1.02. This is not a cause for concern.
     __________________________________________________________________

Dump/Reload Procedure

   If you are trying to reload a pg_dump or text-mode, copy tablename to
   stdout generated with a previous version, you will need to run the
   attached "sed" script on the ASCII file before loading it into the
   database. The old format used '.' as end-of-data, while '\.' is now the
   end-of-data marker. Also, empty strings are now loaded in as '' rather
   than NULL. See the copy manual page for full details.
        sed 's/^\.$/\\./g' <in_file >out_file

   If you are loading an older binary copy or non-stdout copy, there is no
   end-of-data character, and hence no conversion necessary.

Migration from version 1.0 to version 1.01

   The following notes are for the benefit of users who want to migrate
   databases from Postgres95 1.0 to Postgres95 1.01.

   If you are starting afresh with Postgres95 1.01 and do not need to
   migrate old databases, you do not need to read any further.

   In order to Postgres95 version 1.01 with databases created with
   Postgres95 version 1.0, the following steps are required:
    1. Set the definition of NAMEDATALEN in "src/Makefile.global" to 16
       and OIDNAMELEN to 20.
    2. Decide whether you want to use Host based authentication.
         a. If you do, you must create a file name pg_hba in your
            top-level data directory (typically the value of your
            $PGDATA). "src/libpq/pg_hba" shows an example syntax.
         b. If you do not want host-based authentication, you can comment
            out the line
        HBA = 1
            in "src/Makefile.global"
            Note that host-based authentication is turned on by default,
            and if you do not take steps A or B above, the out-of-the-box
            1.01 will not allow you to connect to 1.0 databases.
    3. Compile and install 1.01, but DO NOT do the "initdb" step.
    4. Before doing anything else, terminate your 1.0 postmaster, and
       backup your existing $PGDATA directory.
    5. Set your PGDATA environment variable to your 1.0 databases, but set
       up path up so that 1.01 binaries are being used.
    6. Modify the file "$PGDATA/PG_VERSION" from 5.0 to 5.1
    7. Start up a new 1.01 postmaster
    8. Add the new built-in functions and operators of 1.01 to 1.0
       databases. This is done by running the new 1.01 server against your
       own 1.0 database and applying the queries attached and saving in
       the file 1.0_to_1.01.sql. This can be done easily through "psql".
       If your 1.0 database is name testdb:
        % psql testdb -f 1.0_to_1.01.sql
       and then execute the following commands (cut and paste from here):
-- add builtin functions that are new to 1.01

create function int4eqoid (int4, oid) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function oideqint4 (oid, int4) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char2icregexeq (char2, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char2icregexne (char2, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char4icregexeq (char4, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char4icregexne (char4, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char8icregexeq (char8, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char8icregexne (char8, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char16icregexeq (char16, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function char16icregexne (char16, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function texticregexeq (text, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';
create function texticregexne (text, text) returns bool as 'foo'
language 'internal';

-- add builtin functions that are new to 1.01

create operator = (leftarg = int4, rightarg = oid, procedure = int4eqoid);
create operator = (leftarg = oid, rightarg = int4, procedure = oideqint4);
create operator ~* (leftarg = char2, rightarg = text, procedure = char2icregexeq
);
create operator !~* (leftarg = char2, rightarg = text, procedure = char2icregexn
e);
create operator ~* (leftarg = char4, rightarg = text, procedure = char4icregexeq
);
create operator !~* (leftarg = char4, rightarg = text, procedure = char4icregexn
e);
create operator ~* (leftarg = char8, rightarg = text, procedure = char8icregexeq
);
create operator !~* (leftarg = char8, rightarg = text, procedure = char8icregexn
e);
create operator ~* (leftarg = char16, rightarg = text, procedure = char16icregex
eq);
create operator !~* (leftarg = char16, rightarg = text, procedure = char16icrege
xne);
create operator ~* (leftarg = text, rightarg = text, procedure = texticregexeq);
create operator !~* (leftarg = text, rightarg = text, procedure = texticregexne)
;
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Incompatibilities:
 * 1.01 is backwards compatible with 1.0 database provided the user
   follow the steps outlined in the MIGRATION_from_1.0_to_1.01 file.
   If those steps are not taken, 1.01 is not compatible with 1.0 database.

Enhancements:
 * added PQdisplayTuples() to libpq and changed monitor and psql to use it
 * added NeXT port (requires SysVIPC implementation)
 * added CAST .. AS ... syntax
 * added ASC and DESC key words
 * added 'internal' as a possible language for CREATE FUNCTION
   internal functions are C functions which have been statically linked
   into the postgres backend.
 * a new type "name" has been added for system identifiers (table names,
   attribute names, etc.)  This replaces the old char16 type.   The
   of name is set by the NAMEDATALEN #define in src/Makefile.global
 * a readable reference manual that describes the query language.
 * added host-based access control.  A configuration file ($PGDATA/pg_hba)
   is used to hold the configuration data.  If host-based access control
   is not desired, comment out HBA=1 in src/Makefile.global.
 * changed regex handling to be uniform use of Henry Spencer's regex code
   regardless of platform.  The regex code is included in the distribution
 * added functions and operators for case-insensitive regular expressions.
   The operators are ~* and !~*.
 * pg_dump uses COPY instead of SELECT loop for better performance

Bug fixes:
 * fixed an optimizer bug that was causing core dumps when
   functions calls were used in comparisons in the WHERE clause
 * changed all uses of getuid to geteuid so that effective uids are used
 * psql now returns non-zero status on errors when using -c
 * applied public patches 1-14

Changes

Copyright change:
 * The copyright of Postgres 1.0 has been loosened to be freely modifiable
   and modifiable for any purpose.  Please read the COPYRIGHT file.
   Thanks to Professor Michael Stonebraker for making this possible.

Incompatibilities:
 *  date formats have to be MM-DD-YYYY (or DD-MM-YYYY if you're using
   EUROPEAN STYLE).  This follows SQL-92 specs.
 *  "delimiters" is now a key word

Enhancements:
 *  sql LIKE syntax has been added
 *  copy command now takes an optional USING DELIMITER specification.
   delimiters can be any single-character string.
 *  IRIX 5.3 port has been added.
   Thanks to Paul Walmsley and others.
 *  updated pg_dump to work with new libpq
 *  \d has been added psql
   Thanks to Keith Parks
 *  regexp performance for architectures that use POSIX regex has been
   improved due to caching of precompiled patterns.
   Thanks to Alistair Crooks
 *  a new version of libpq++
   Thanks to William Wanders

Bug fixes:
 *  arbitrary userids can be specified in the createuser script
 *  \c to connect to other databases in psql now works.
 *  bad pg_proc entry for float4inc() is fixed
 *  users with usecreatedb field set can now create databases without
   having to be usesuper
 *  remove access control entries when the entry no longer has any
   privileges
 *  fixed non-portable datetimes implementation
 *  added kerberos flags to the src/backend/Makefile
 *  libpq now works with kerberos
 *  typographic errors in the user manual have been corrected.
 *  btrees with multiple index never worked, now we tell you they don't
   work when you try to use them

     Release date: 1995-07-21
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Incompatible changes:
 * BETA-0.3 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH DATABASES CREATED WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
   (due to system catalog changes and indexing structure changes).
 * double-quote (") is deprecated as a quoting character for string literals;
   you need to convert them to single quotes (').
 * name of aggregates (eg. int4sum) are renamed in accordance with the
   SQL standard (eg. sum).
 * CHANGE ACL syntax is replaced by GRANT/REVOKE syntax.
 * float literals (eg. 3.14) are now of type float4 (instead of float8 in
   previous releases); you might have to do typecasting if you depend on it
   being of type float8.  If you neglect to do the typecasting and you assign
   a float literal to a field of type float8, you may get incorrect values
   stored!
 * LIBPQ has been totally revamped so that frontend applications
   can connect to multiple backends
 * the usesysid field in pg_user has been changed from int2 to int4 to
   allow wider range of Unix user ids.
 * the netbsd/freebsd/bsd o/s ports have been consolidated into a
   single BSD44_derived port.  (thanks to Alistair Crooks)

SQL standard-compliance (the following details changes that makes postgres95
more compliant to the SQL-92 standard):
 * the following SQL types are now built-in: smallint, int(eger), float, real,
   char(N), varchar(N), date and time.

   The following are aliases to existing postgres types:
                smallint -> int2
                integer, int -> int4
                float, real  -> float4
   char(N) and varchar(N) are implemented as truncated text types. In
   addition, char(N) does blank-padding.
 * single-quote (') is used for quoting string literals; '' (in addition to
   \') is supported as means of inserting a single quote in a string
 * SQL standard aggregate names (MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, COUNT) are used
   (Also, aggregates can now be overloaded, i.e. you can define your
   own MAX aggregate to take in a user-defined type.)
 * CHANGE ACL removed. GRANT/REVOKE syntax added.
   - Privileges can be given to a group using the "GROUP" key word.
        For example:
                GRANT SELECT ON foobar TO GROUP my_group;
        The key word 'PUBLIC' is also supported to mean all users.

        Privileges can only be granted or revoked to one user or group
        at a time.

        "WITH GRANT OPTION" is not supported.  Only class owners can change
        access control
   - The default access control is to to grant users readonly access.
     You must explicitly grant insert/update access to users.  To change
     this, modify the line in
                src/backend/utils/acl.h
     that defines ACL_WORLD_DEFAULT

Bug fixes:
 * the bug where aggregates of empty tables were not run has been fixed. Now,
   aggregates run on empty tables will return the initial conditions of the
   aggregates. Thus, COUNT of an empty  table will now properly return 0.
   MAX/MIN of an empty table will return a row of value NULL.
 * allow the use of \; inside the monitor
 * the LISTEN/NOTIFY asynchronous notification mechanism now work
 * NOTIFY in rule action bodies now work
 * hash indexes work, and access methods in general should perform better.
   creation of large btree indexes should be much faster.  (thanks to Paul
   Aoki)

Other changes and enhancements:
 * addition of an EXPLAIN statement used for explaining the query execution
   plan (eg. "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM EMP" prints out the execution plan for
   the query).
 * WARN and NOTICE messages no longer have timestamps on them. To turn on
   timestamps of error messages, uncomment the line in
   src/backend/utils/elog.h:
        /* define ELOG_TIMESTAMPS */
 * On an access control violation, the message
        "Either no such class or insufficient privilege"
   will be given.  This is the same message that is returned when
   a class is not found.  This dissuades non-privileged users from
   guessing the existence of privileged classes.
 * some additional system catalog changes have been made that are not
   visible to the user.

libpgtcl changes:
 * The -oid option has been added to the "pg_result" tcl command.
   pg_result -oid returns oid of the last row inserted.   If the
   last command was not an INSERT, then pg_result -oid returns "".
 * the large object interface is available as pg_lo* tcl commands:
   pg_lo_open, pg_lo_close, pg_lo_creat, etc.

Portability enhancements and New Ports:
 * flex/lex problems have been cleared up.  Now, you should be able to use
   flex instead of lex on any platforms.  We no longer make assumptions of
   what lexer you use based on the platform you use.
 * The Linux-ELF port is now supported.  Various configuration have been
   tested:  The following configuration is known to work:
        kernel 1.2.10, gcc 2.6.3, libc 4.7.2, flex 2.5.2, bison 1.24
   with everything in ELF format,

New utilities:
 * ipcclean added to the distribution
   ipcclean usually does not need to be run, but if your backend crashes
   and leaves shared memory segments hanging around, ipcclean will
   clean them up for you.

New documentation:
 * the user manual has been revised and libpq documentation added.

                           Postgres95 Release 0.02

     Release date: 1995-05-25
     __________________________________________________________________

Changes

Incompatible changes:
 * The SQL statement for creating a database is 'CREATE DATABASE' instead
   of 'CREATEDB'. Similarly, dropping a database is 'DROP DATABASE' instead
   of 'DESTROYDB'. However, the names of the executables 'createdb' and
   'destroydb' remain the same.

New tools:
 * pgperl - a Perl (4.036) interface to Postgres95
 * pg_dump - a utility for dumping out a postgres database into a
        script file containing query commands. The script files are in a ASCII
        format and can be used to reconstruct the database, even on other
        machines and other architectures. (Also good for converting
        a Postgres 4.2 database to Postgres95 database.)

The following ports have been incorporated into postgres95-beta-0.02:
 * the NetBSD port by Alistair Crooks
 * the AIX port by Mike Tung
 * the Windows NT port by Jon Forrest (more stuff but not done yet)
 * the Linux ELF port by Brian Gallew

The following bugs have been fixed in postgres95-beta-0.02:
 * new lines not escaped in COPY OUT and problem with COPY OUT when first
   attribute is a '.'
 * cannot type return to use the default user id in createuser
 * SELECT DISTINCT on big tables crashes
 * Linux installation problems
 * monitor doesn't allow use of 'localhost' as PGHOST
 * psql core dumps when doing \c or \l
 * the "pgtclsh" target missing from src/bin/pgtclsh/Makefile
 * libpgtcl has a hard-wired default port number
 * SELECT DISTINCT INTO TABLE hangs
 * CREATE TYPE doesn't accept 'variable' as the internallength
 * wrong result using more than 1 aggregate in a SELECT
