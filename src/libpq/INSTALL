   This document describes the installation of PostgreSQL from the source
   code distribution. (If you are installing a pre-packaged distribution,
   such as an RPM or Debian package, ignore this document and read the
   packager's instructions instead.)

                                Requirements

   In general, a modern Unix-compatible platform should be able to run
   PostgreSQL. The platforms that had received specific testing at the
   time of release are listed in the Section called Supported Platforms
   below. In the "doc" subdirectory of the distribution there are several
   platform-specific FAQ documents you might wish to consult if you are
   having trouble.

   The following software packages are required for building PostgreSQL:

     * GNU make is required; other make programs will *not* work. GNU make
       is often installed under the name "gmake"; this document will
       always refer to it by that name. (On some systems GNU make is the
       default tool with the name "make".) To test for GNU make enter
gmake --version
       It is recommended to use version 3.76.1 or later.
     * You need an ISO/ANSI C compiler. Recent versions of GCC are
       recommendable, but PostgreSQL is known to build with a wide variety
       of compilers from different vendors.
     * tar is required to unpack the source distribution in the first
       place, in addition to either gzip or bzip2.
     * The GNU Readline library (for comfortable line editing and command
       history retrieval) will be used by default. If you don't want to
       use it then you must specify the "--without-readline" option for
       "configure". (On NetBSD, the "libedit" library is
       Readline-compatible and is used if "libreadline" is not found.) If
       you are using a package-based Linux distribution, be aware that you
       need both the readline and readline-devel packages, if those are
       separate in your distribution.
     * The zlib compression library will be used by default. If you don't
       want to use it then you must specify the "--without-zlib" option
       for "configure". Using this option disables support for compressed
       archives in pg_dump and pg_restore.
     * Additional software is needed to build PostgreSQL on Windows. You
       can build PostgreSQL for NT-based versions of Windows (like Windows
       XP and 2003) using MinGW; see "doc/FAQ_MINGW" for details. You can
       also build PostgreSQL using Cygwin; see "doc/FAQ_CYGWIN". A
       Cygwin-based build will work on older versions of Windows, but if
       you have a choice, we recommend the MinGW approach. While these are
       the only tool sets recommended for a complete build, it is possible
       to build just the C client library (libpq) and the interactive
       terminal (psql) using other Windows tool sets. For details of that
       see the documentation chapter "Client-Only Installation on Windows"
       .

   The following packages are optional. They are not required in the
   default configuration, but they are needed when certain build options
   are enabled, as explained below.

     * To build the server programming language PL/Perl you need a full
       Perl installation, including the "libperl" library and the header
       files. Since PL/Perl will be a shared library, the "libperl"
       library must be a shared library also on most platforms. This
       appears to be the default in recent Perl versions, but it was not
       in earlier versions, and in any case it is the choice of whomever
       installed Perl at your site.
       If you don't have the shared library but you need one, a message
       like this will appear during the build to point out this fact:
*** Cannot build PL/Perl because libperl is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Perl installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
       (If you don't follow the on-screen output you will merely notice
       that the PL/Perl library object, "plperl.so" or similar, will not
       be installed.) If you see this, you will have to rebuild and
       install Perl manually to be able to build PL/Perl. During the
       configuration process for Perl, request a shared library.
     * To build the PL/Python server programming language, you need a
       Python installation with the header files and the distutils module.
       The distutils module is included by default with Python 1.6 and
       later; users of earlier versions of Python will need to install it.
       Since PL/Python will be a shared library, the "libpython" library
       must be a shared library also on most platforms. This is not the
       case in a default Python installation. If after building and
       installing you have a file called "plpython.so" (possibly a
       different extension), then everything went well. Otherwise you
       should have seen a notice like this flying by:
*** Cannot build PL/Python because libpython is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your Python installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.
       That means you have to rebuild (part of) your Python installation
       to supply this shared library.
       If you have problems, run Python 2.3 or later's configure using the
       --enable-shared flag. On some operating systems you don't have to
       build a shared library, but you will have to convince the
       PostgreSQL build system of this. Consult the "Makefile" in the
       "src/pl/plpython" directory for details.
     * If you want to build the PL/Tcl procedural language, you of course
       need a Tcl installation.
     * To enable Native Language Support (NLS), that is, the ability to
       display a program's messages in a language other than English, you
       need an implementation of the Gettext API. Some operating systems
       have this built-in (e.g., Linux, NetBSD, Solaris), for other
       systems you can download an add-on package from
       http://developer.postgresql.org/~petere/bsd-gettext/. If you are
       using the Gettext implementation in the GNU C library then you will
       additionally need the GNU Gettext package for some utility
       programs. For any of the other implementations you will not need
       it.
     * Kerberos, OpenSSL, and/or PAM, if you want to support
       authentication or encryption using these services.

   If you are building from a CVS tree instead of using a released source
   package, or if you want to do development, you also need the following
   packages:

     * GNU Flex and Bison are needed to build a CVS checkout or if you
       changed the actual scanner and parser definition files. If you need
       them, be sure to get Flex 2.5.4 or later and Bison 1.875 or later.
       Other yacc programs can sometimes be used, but doing so requires
       extra effort and is not recommended. Other lex programs will
       definitely not work.

   If you need to get a GNU package, you can find it at your local GNU
   mirror site (see http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html for a list) or at
   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/.

   Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about 65
   MB for the source tree during compilation and about 15 MB for the
   installation directory. An empty database cluster takes about 25 MB,
   databases take about five times the amount of space that a flat text
   file with the same data would take. If you are going to run the
   regression tests you will temporarily need up to an extra 90 MB. Use
   the "df" command to check free disk space.
     __________________________________________________________________

                            If You Are Upgrading

   The internal data storage format changes with new releases of
   PostgreSQL. Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing installation
   that does not have a version number "8.1.x", you must back up and
   restore your data as shown here. These instructions assume that your
   existing installation is under the "/usr/local/pgsql" directory, and
   that the data area is in "/usr/local/pgsql/data". Substitute your paths
   appropriately.
    1. Make sure that your database is not updated during or after the
       backup. This does not affect the integrity of the backup, but the
       changed data would of course not be included. If necessary, edit
       the permissions in the file "/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf" (or
       equivalent) to disallow access from everyone except you.
    2. To back up your database installation, type:
pg_dumpall > outputfile
       If you need to preserve OIDs (such as when using them as foreign
       keys), then use the "-o" option when running pg_dumpall.
       To make the backup, you can use the pg_dumpall command from the
       version you are currently running. For best results, however, try
       to use the pg_dumpall command from PostgreSQL 8.1.4, since this
       version contains bug fixes and improvements over older versions.
       While this advice might seem idiosyncratic since you haven't
       installed the new version yet, it is advisable to follow it if you
       plan to install the new version in parallel with the old version.
       In that case you can complete the installation normally and
       transfer the data later. This will also decrease the downtime.
    3. If you are installing the new version at the same location as the
       old one then shut down the old server, at the latest before you
       install the new files:
pg_ctl stop
       On systems that have PostgreSQL started at boot time, there is
       probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For
       example, on a Red Hat Linux system one might find that
/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql stop
       works.
       Very old versions might not have pg_ctl. If you can't find it or it
       doesn't work, find out the process ID of the old server, for
       example by typing
ps ax | grep postmaster
       and signal it to stop this way:
kill -INT processID
    4. If you are installing in the same place as the old version then it
       is also a good idea to move the old installation out of the way, in
       case you have trouble and need to revert to it. Use a command like
       this:
mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old

   After you have installed PostgreSQL 8.1.4, create a new database
   directory and start the new server. Remember that you must execute
   these commands while logged in to the special database user account
   (which you already have if you are upgrading).
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

   Finally, restore your data with
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -d postgres -f outputfile

   using the *new* psql.

   Further discussion appears in the documentation, which you are
   encouraged to read in any case.

                           Installation Procedure

    1. Configuration
       The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
       source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
       This is done by running the "configure" script. For a default
       installation simply enter
./configure
       This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
       system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your operating
       system, and finally will create several files in the build tree to
       record what it found. (You can also run "configure" in a directory
       outside the source tree if you want to keep the build directory
       separate.)
       The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
       well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
       C compiler. All files will be installed under "/usr/local/pgsql" by
       default.
       You can customize the build and installation process by supplying
       one or more of the following command line options to "configure":

        --prefix=PREFIX
                Install all files under the directory "PREFIX" instead of
                "/usr/local/pgsql". The actual files will be installed
                into various subdirectories; no files will ever be
                installed directly into the "PREFIX" directory.

                If you have special needs, you can also customize the
                individual subdirectories with the following options.
                However, if you leave these with their defaults, the
                installation will be relocatable, meaning you can move the
                directory after installation. (The man and doc locations
                are not affected by this.)

                For relocatable installs, you might want to use
                "configure"'s --disable-rpath option. Also, you will need
                to tell the operating system how to find the shared
                libraries.

        --exec-prefix=EXEC-PREFIX
                You can install architecture-dependent files under a
                different prefix, "EXEC-PREFIX", than what "PREFIX" was
                set to. This can be useful to share
                architecture-independent files between hosts. If you omit
                this, then "EXEC-PREFIX" is set equal to "PREFIX" and both
                architecture-dependent and independent files will be
                installed under the same tree, which is probably what you
                want.

        --bindir=DIRECTORY
                Specifies the directory for executable programs. The
                default is "EXEC-PREFIX/bin", which normally means
                "/usr/local/pgsql/bin".

        --datadir=DIRECTORY
                Sets the directory for read-only data files used by the
                installed programs. The default is "PREFIX/share". Note
                that this has nothing to do with where your database files
                will be placed.

        --sysconfdir=DIRECTORY
                The directory for various configuration files,
                "PREFIX/etc" by default.

        --libdir=DIRECTORY
                The location to install libraries and dynamically loadable
                modules. The default is "EXEC-PREFIX/lib".

        --includedir=DIRECTORY
                The directory for installing C and C++ header files. The
                default is "PREFIX/include".

        --mandir=DIRECTORY
                The man pages that come with PostgreSQL will be installed
                under this directory, in their respective "manx"
                subdirectories. The default is "PREFIX/man".

        --with-docdir=DIRECTORY, --without-docdir
                Documentation files, except "man" pages, will be installed
                into this directory. The default is "PREFIX/doc". If the
                option "--without-docdir" is specified, the documentation
                will not be installed by "make install". This is intended
                for packaging scripts that have special methods for
                installing documentation.

     Note: Care has been taken to make it possible to install PostgreSQL
     into shared installation locations (such as "/usr/local/include")
     without interfering with the namespace of the rest of the system.
     First, the string "/postgresql" is automatically appended to
     datadir, sysconfdir, and docdir, unless the fully expanded directory
     name already contains the string "postgres" or "pgsql". For example,
     if you choose "/usr/local" as prefix, the documentation will be
     installed in "/usr/local/doc/postgresql", but if the prefix is
     "/opt/postgres", then it will be in "/opt/postgres/doc". The public
     C header files of the client interfaces are installed into
     includedir and are namespace-clean. The internal header files and
     the server header files are installed into private directories under
     includedir. See the documentation of each interface for information
     about how to get at the its header files. Finally, a private
     subdirectory will also be created, if appropriate, under libdir for
     dynamically loadable modules.

        --with-includes=DIRECTORIES
                "DIRECTORIES" is a colon-separated list of directories
                that will be added to the list the compiler searches for
                header files. If you have optional packages (such as GNU
                Readline) installed in a non-standard location, you have
                to use this option and probably also the corresponding
                "--with-libraries" option.

                Example:
                --with-includes=/opt/gnu/include:/usr/sup/include.

        --with-libraries=DIRECTORIES
                "DIRECTORIES" is a colon-separated list of directories to
                search for libraries. You will probably have to use this
                option (and the corresponding "--with-includes" option) if
                you have packages installed in non-standard locations.

                Example: --with-libraries=/opt/gnu/lib:/usr/sup/lib.

        --enable-nls[=LANGUAGES]
                Enables Native Language Support (NLS), that is, the
                ability to display a program's messages in a language
                other than English. "LANGUAGES" is a space-separated list
                of codes of the languages that you want supported, for
                example --enable-nls='de fr'. (The intersection between
                your list and the set of actually provided translations
                will be computed automatically.) If you do not specify a
                list, then all available translations are installed.

                To use this option, you will need an implementation of the
                Gettext API; see above.

        --with-pgport=NUMBER
                Set "NUMBER" as the default port number for server and
                clients. The default is 5432. The port can always be
                changed later on, but if you specify it here then both
                server and clients will have the same default compiled in,
                which can be very convenient. Usually the only good reason
                to select a non-default value is if you intend to run
                multiple PostgreSQL servers on the same machine.

        --with-perl
                Build the PL/Perl server-side language.

        --with-python
                Build the PL/Python server-side language.

        --with-tcl
                Build the PL/Tcl server-side language.

        --with-tclconfig=DIRECTORY
                Tcl installs the file "tclConfig.sh", which contains
                configuration information needed to build modules
                interfacing to Tcl. This file is normally found
                automatically at a well-known location, but if you want to
                use a different version of Tcl you can specify the
                directory in which to look for it.

        --with-krb5
                Build with support for Kerberos 5 authentication. On many
                systems, the Kerberos system is not installed in a
                location that is searched by default (e.g.,
                "/usr/include", "/usr/lib"), so you must use the options
                "--with-includes" and "--with-libraries" in addition to
                this option. "configure" will check for the required
                header files and libraries to make sure that your Kerberos
                installation is sufficient before proceeding.

        --with-krb-srvnam=NAME
                The default name of the Kerberos service principal.
                postgres is the default. There's usually no reason to
                change this.

        --with-openssl
                Build with support for SSL (encrypted) connections. This
                requires the OpenSSL package to be installed. "configure"
                will check for the required header files and libraries to
                make sure that your OpenSSL installation is sufficient
                before proceeding.

        --with-pam
                Build with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) support.

        --without-readline
                Prevents use of the Readline library. This disables
                command-line editing and history in psql, so it is not
                recommended.

        --with-bonjour
                Build with Bonjour support. This requires Bonjour support
                in your operating system. Recommended on Mac OS X.

        --enable-integer-datetimes
                Use 64-bit integer storage for datetimes and intervals,
                rather than the default floating-point storage. This
                reduces the range of representable values but guarantees
                microsecond precision across the full range (see the
                documentation about datetime datatypes for more
                information). Note also that the integer datetimes code is
                newer than the floating-point code, and we still find bugs
                in it from time to time.

        --disable-spinlocks
                Allow the build to succeed even if PostgreSQL has no CPU
                spinlock support for the platform. The lack of spinlock
                support will result in poor performance; therefore, this
                option should only be used if the build aborts and informs
                you that the platform lacks spinlock support. If this
                option is required to build PostgreSQL on your platform,
                please report the problem to the PostgreSQL developers.

        --enable-thread-safety
                Make the client libraries thread-safe. This allows
                concurrent threads in libpq and ECPG programs to safely
                control their private connection handles. This option
                requires adequate threading support in your operating
                system.

        --without-zlib
                Prevents use of the Zlib library. This disables support
                for compressed archives in pg_dump and pg_restore. This
                option is only intended for those rare systems where this
                library is not available.

        --enable-debug
                Compiles all programs and libraries with debugging
                symbols. This means that you can run the programs through
                a debugger to analyze problems. This enlarges the size of
                the installed executables considerably, and on non-GCC
                compilers it usually also disables compiler optimization,
                causing slowdowns. However, having the symbols available
                is extremely helpful for dealing with any problems that
                may arise. Currently, this option is recommended for
                production installations only if you use GCC. But you
                should always have it on if you are doing development work
                or running a beta version.

        --enable-cassert
                Enables assertion checks in the server, which test for
                many "can't happen" conditions. This is invaluable for
                code development purposes, but the tests slow things down
                a little. Also, having the tests turned on won't
                necessarily enhance the stability of your server! The
                assertion checks are not categorized for severity, and so
                what might be a relatively harmless bug will still lead to
                server restarts if it triggers an assertion failure.
                Currently, this option is not recommended for production
                use, but you should have it on for development work or
                when running a beta version.

        --enable-depend
                Enables automatic dependency tracking. With this option,
                the makefiles are set up so that all affected object files
                will be rebuilt when any header file is changed. This is
                useful if you are doing development work, but is just
                wasted overhead if you intend only to compile once and
                install. At present, this option will work only if you use
                GCC.

       If you prefer a C compiler different from the one "configure"
       picks, you can set the environment variable CC to the program of
       your choice. By default, "configure" will pick "gcc" if available,
       else the platform's default (usually "cc"). Similarly, you can
       override the default compiler flags if needed with the CFLAGS
       variable.
       You can specify environment variables on the "configure" command
       line, for example:
./configure CC=/opt/bin/gcc CFLAGS='-O2 -pipe'
    2. Build
       To start the build, type
gmake
       (Remember to use GNU make.) The build may take anywhere from 5
       minutes to half an hour depending on your hardware. The last line
       displayed should be
All of PostgreSQL is successfully made. Ready to install.
    3. Regression Tests
       If you want to test the newly built server before you install it,
       you can run the regression tests at this point. The regression
       tests are a test suite to verify that PostgreSQL runs on your
       machine in the way the developers expected it to. Type
gmake check
       (This won't work as root; do it as an unprivileged user.) The file
       "src/test/regress/README" and the documentation contain detailed
       information about interpreting the test results. You can repeat
       this test at any later time by issuing the same command.
    4. Installing The Files

     Note: If you are upgrading an existing system and are going to
     install the new files over the old ones, be sure to back up your
     data and shut down the old server before proceeding, as explained in
     the Section called If You Are Upgrading above.
       To install PostgreSQL enter
gmake install
       This will install files into the directories that were specified in
       step 1. Make sure that you have appropriate permissions to write
       into that area. Normally you need to do this step as root.
       Alternatively, you could create the target directories in advance
       and arrange for appropriate permissions to be granted.
       You can use gmake install-strip instead of gmake install to strip
       the executable files and libraries as they are installed. This will
       save some space. If you built with debugging support, stripping
       will effectively remove the debugging support, so it should only be
       done if debugging is no longer needed. install-strip tries to do a
       reasonable job saving space, but it does not have perfect knowledge
       of how to strip every unneeded byte from an executable file, so if
       you want to save all the disk space you possibly can, you will have
       to do manual work.
       The standard installation provides all the header files needed for
       client application development as well as for server-side program
       development, such as custom functions or data types written in C.
       (Prior to PostgreSQL 8.0, a separate gmake install-all-headers
       command was needed for the latter, but this step has been folded
       into the standard install.)
       Client-only installation: If you want to install only the client
       applications and interface libraries, then you can use these
       commands:
gmake -C src/bin install
gmake -C src/include install
gmake -C src/interfaces install
gmake -C doc install

   Registering eventlog on Windows: To register a Windows eventlog library
   with the operating system, issue this command after installation:
regsvr32 pgsql_library_directory/pgevent.dll

   This creates registry entries used by the event viewer.

   Uninstallation: To undo the installation use the command "gmake
   uninstall". However, this will not remove any created directories.

   Cleaning: After the installation you can make room by removing the
   built files from the source tree with the command "gmake clean". This
   will preserve the files made by the "configure" program, so that you
   can rebuild everything with "gmake" later on. To reset the source tree
   to the state in which it was distributed, use "gmake distclean". If you
   are going to build for several platforms within the same source tree
   you must do this and re-configure for each build. (Alternatively, use a
   separate build tree for each platform, so that the source tree remains
   unmodified.)

   If you perform a build and then discover that your "configure" options
   were wrong, or if you change anything that "configure" investigates
   (for example, software upgrades), then it's a good idea to do "gmake
   distclean" before reconfiguring and rebuilding. Without this, your
   changes in configuration choices may not propagate everywhere they need
   to.

                           Post-Installation Setup

Shared Libraries

   On some systems that have shared libraries (which most systems do) you
   need to tell your system how to find the newly installed shared
   libraries. The systems on which this is *not* necessary include BSD/OS,
   FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Tru64 UNIX (formerly
   Digital UNIX), and Solaris.

   The method to set the shared library search path varies between
   platforms, but the most widely usable method is to set the environment
   variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH like so: In Bourne shells ("sh", "ksh",
   "bash", "zsh")
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   or in "csh" or "tcsh"
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib

   Replace /usr/local/pgsql/lib with whatever you set "--libdir" to in
   step 1. You should put these commands into a shell start-up file such
   as "/etc/profile" or "~/.bash_profile". Some good information about the
   caveats associated with this method can be found at
   http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html.

   On some systems it might be preferable to set the environment variable
   LD_RUN_PATH *before* building.

   On Cygwin, put the library directory in the PATH or move the ".dll"
   files into the "bin" directory.

   If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system (perhaps "ld.so"
   or "rld"). If you later on get a message like
psql: error in loading shared libraries
libpq.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

   then this step was necessary. Simply take care of it then.

   If you are on BSD/OS, Linux, or SunOS 4 and you have root access you
   can run
/sbin/ldconfig /usr/local/pgsql/lib

   (or equivalent directory) after installation to enable the run-time
   linker to find the shared libraries faster. Refer to the manual page of
   "ldconfig" for more information. On FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD the
   command is
/sbin/ldconfig -m /usr/local/pgsql/lib

   instead. Other systems are not known to have an equivalent command.
     __________________________________________________________________

Environment Variables

   If you installed into "/usr/local/pgsql" or some other location that is
   not searched for programs by default, you should add
   "/usr/local/pgsql/bin" (or whatever you set "--bindir" to in step 1)
   into your PATH. Strictly speaking, this is not necessary, but it will
   make the use of PostgreSQL much more convenient.

   To do this, add the following to your shell start-up file, such as
   "~/.bash_profile" (or "/etc/profile", if you want it to affect every
   user):
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
export PATH

   If you are using "csh" or "tcsh", then use this command:
set path = ( /usr/local/pgsql/bin $path )

   To enable your system to find the man documentation, you need to add
   lines like the following to a shell start-up file unless you installed
   into a location that is searched by default.
MANPATH=/usr/local/pgsql/man:$MANPATH
export MANPATH

   The environment variables PGHOST and PGPORT specify to client
   applications the host and port of the database server, overriding the
   compiled-in defaults. If you are going to run client applications
   remotely then it is convenient if every user that plans to use the
   database sets PGHOST. This is not required, however: the settings can
   be communicated via command line options to most client programs.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Getting Started

   The following is a quick summary of how to get PostgreSQL up and
   running once installed. The main documentation contains more
   information.
    1. Create a user account for the PostgreSQL server. This is the user
       the server will run as. For production use you should create a
       separate, unprivileged account ("postgres" is commonly used). If
       you do not have root access or just want to play around, your own
       user account is enough, but running the server as root is a
       security risk and will not work.
adduser postgres
    2. Create a database installation with the "initdb" command. To run
       "initdb" you must be logged in to your PostgreSQL server account.
       It will not work as root.
root# mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
root# chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
root# su - postgres
postgres$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
       The "-D" option specifies the location where the data will be
       stored. You can use any path you want, it does not have to be under
       the installation directory. Just make sure that the server account
       can write to the directory (or create it, if it doesn't already
       exist) before starting "initdb", as illustrated here.
    3. The previous step should have told you how to start up the database
       server. Do so now. The command should look something like
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
       This will start the server in the foreground. To put the server in
       the background use something like
nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \
    </dev/null >>server.log 2>&1 </dev/null &
       To stop a server running in the background you can type
kill `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`
       In order to allow TCP/IP connections (rather than only Unix domain
       socket ones) you need to pass the "-i" option to "postmaster".
    4. Create a database:
createdb testdb
       Then enter
psql testdb
       to connect to that database. At the prompt you can enter SQL
       commands and start experimenting.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  What Now?

     * The PostgreSQL distribution contains a comprehensive documentation
       set, which you should read sometime. After installation, the
       documentation can be accessed by pointing your browser to
       "/usr/local/pgsql/doc/html/index.html", unless you changed the
       installation directories.
       The first few chapters of the main documentation are the Tutorial,
       which should be your first reading if you are completely new to SQL
       databases. If you are familiar with database concepts then you want
       to proceed with part on server administration, which contains
       information about how to set up the database server, database
       users, and authentication.
     * Usually, you will want to modify your computer so that it will
       automatically start the database server whenever it boots. Some
       suggestions for this are in the documentation.
     * Run the regression tests against the installed server (using "gmake
       installcheck"). If you didn't run the tests before installation,
       you should definitely do it now. This is also explained in the
       documentation.
     * By default, PostgreSQL is configured to run on minimal hardware.
       This allows it to start up with almost any hardware configuration.
       The default configuration is, however, not designed for optimum
       performance. To achieve optimum performance, several server
       parameters must be adjusted, the two most common being
       shared_buffers and work_mem. Other parameters mentioned in the
       documentation also affect performance.
     __________________________________________________________________

                             Supported Platforms

   PostgreSQL has been verified by the developer community to work on the
   platforms listed below. A supported platform generally means that
   PostgreSQL builds and installs according to these instructions and that
   the regression tests pass. "Build farm" entries refer to active test
   machines in the PostgreSQL Build Farm. Platform entries that show an
   older version of PostgreSQL are those that did not receive explicit
   testing at the time of release of version 8.1 but that we still expect
   to work.

     Note: If you are having problems with the installation on a
     supported platform, please write to <pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org> or
     <pgsql-ports@postgresql.org>, not to the people listed here.
